#EVENTS
austria.1.t:"The Status of Austria"
austria.1.d: "In 1914, the Austrian Empire had entered the Great War with high hopes for victory, both to assert their dominance over Serbia, and to avenge the life of the Archduke. However, not all was well for them, as they found themselves getting thrown back more and more on every front they fought. Eventually, when the citizens of the Empire realized the war was over for the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, the rights for the ethnic minorities were increased, as more and more liberal politicians took control in Vienna and Budapest. These events all culminated in the forming of a huge popularity base for the leftist, pro-entente parties that opposed the monarchy. Once the dust had settled, and Austria laid in shambles, with the Treaty of Versailles, putting an end to it once and for all.On 11 November, Karl issued a carefully worded proclamation in which he recognized the Austrian people's right to determine the form of the state. He also renounced the right to participate in Austrian affairs of state. He also dismissed Lammasch and his government from office and released the officials in the Austrian half of the empire from their oath of loyalty to him. Two days later, he issued a similar proclamation for Hungary. However, he did not abdicate, remaining available in the event the people of either state should recall him. For all intents and purposes, this was the end of Habsburg rule.Karl's refusal to abdicate was ultimately irrelevant. On the day after he announced his withdrawal from Austria's politics, the Grand Coalition of Social Democrats and Social Conservatives headed by Karl Renner proclaimed the Republic of German Austria.  A wide range of social reforms were introduced by Renner's government, including unemployment insurance, paid holidays, the eight-hour workday, and regulations on the working conditions of miners, bakers, women, and children. State aid was also provided for the disabled, together with health insurance for public employees. In addition, a law was passed that provided for collective bargaining and the mediation of disputes. The Coalition didn’t last long though, the Social Catholic party (Which was the more popular among the population) was sick of the Social Democrat leadership and so left the Coalition, the more extreme Member of the Social Democratic Party also splitted and formed the Communist Party. The Ruling Government found itself in a minority and in 1923 the elections confirmed it, passing the Leadership to the Social Conservatives.Both right-wing and left-wing paramilitary forces were created during the 20s. The Heimwehr (Home Resistance) first appeared on 12 May 1920 and became progressively organised over the next three years and the Republikanischer Schutzbund was formed in response to this on 19 February 1923.The Heimwehr started to gain a lot of popularity and by the 1927 election they basically were an independent party, the Conservative Leadership saw an opportunity with them and formed a coalition, in the meanwhile the Left was very divided so the elections ended with a decisive CS-Heimwehr victory. This led to massive protests and a fire at the Justizpalast in Vienna, since a lot of people saw the Heimwehr as a brutal and oppressive organisation. In the July Revolt of 1927, 89 protesters were killed by the Austrian police forces. Political conflict escalated until the early 1930s. The attempted assassination of President Wilhelm Miklas made the grip of the party even thighter. This situation has continued until today, but with the rise of Valkism in Germany many in the youth are starting to identify themsleves as German and so seeking an Anchschluss with them, the Left also is realizing that if they want to return relevant outside Red Wien they need to end their infights"
austria.1.a: "We must make our choices carefully."
austria.2.t: "The 1937 Election"
austria.2.d:"After the Great War ended, and Austria became it's own, independent country, a Social Democrat coalition help to modernize and inspire the people of this country, after such a horrific event. However, the coalition quickly fell apart, and the divide became more and more intense, with many parties forming their own paramilitary units. This eventually culminated into a series of political protests, which ended in the lives of 89 protestors dead. Now, the politics of Austria, with the latest election, hang in the balance, and the victory could determine the path Austria is to take for many years to come."
austria.2.a: "The SDAPÖ-KPÖ Coalition"
austria.2.b: "The CSP"
austria.2.c: "The CSP-Heimwehr Coalition"
austria.3.t: "The SDAPO seeks a coalition with the KPO"
austria.3.d: "In light of the recent election, the SDAPO is seeking a coalition with a fellow socialist party, the KPO, to help both increase popularity and backing for Socialist ideals in Austria, and to hopefully beat out the other reactionaries and conservatives."
austria.3.a: "An agreement issn't reached, the coalition isn't formed."
austria.3.b: "The SDAPO and KPO agree to form a Coalition."
austria.4.t: "The Status of the Coalition"
austria.4.d: "In the recent elections, the SDAPO and KPO stand at odds with each other, based on their different Socialist platforms. As of right now, the SDAPO can decide to go solo, or try to compromise and agree to some reforms with the KPO. The KPO, if lucky enough, could also gain a majortiy, and come out triumphant"
austria.4.a: "The SDAPÖ respects the Coalition and agrees to some reforms.
austria.4.b: "The SDAPÖ rules alone!"
austria.4.c: "The KPÖ gains a majority!"
austria.5.t: "The Crackdown on Valkists & German agitators"
austria.5.d: "Ever since [GER.GetLeader] came to power in Germany, his fanatical cries to unite all Germans has long since threatened the sovreignty and existence of our nation. Unfortunately, these ideals shouted by Adam Dressler have struck a cord with many of the Valkists and Germans within our area, and they continue to be a threat to our stability and prosperity. We must crackdown on these people to eliminate any threats to our nation, and so we can continue to exist as one."
austria.5.a: "Put them back behind bars!"
austria.6.t: "Mounting dissent from the Radical-Left"
austria.6.d: "Ever since the results of the last election, the radical leftist members have vehemently opposed them and us. This has lead to numerous protest, riots, and other forms of political aggression throughout the countryside. However, at the present time, there is nothing we can do about this strain on our politics."
austria.6.a: "Worrying, to say the least"
austria.7.t: "KPÖ Riots in Wien!"
austria.7.d: "Things are not looking good for us so far. The dissent among the radicals has only increased further and further as the days have been passing by. Today, we are seeing a first hand example of that. In Wien, our glorious capital, the local members of the KPO have surrounded our parliament building, and are currently holding a massive riot. It appears that in grave situations like these, we can only use the most extreme of measures."
austria.7.a: "Deploy the Army!"
austria.8.t: "The Sozialnationalistische Coup"
austria.8.d: "After the deployment of the Army at the protest, the Austrian people have been growing only more and more paranoid of them, and fear they might drive the country to civil war. The nationalists have thus, taken power, to ensure stability within the country, and crush the Radicals once and for all."
austria.8.a: "Our nation must be protected from the godless Leftists!"
austria.9.t: "The Austrian Civil War"
austria.9.d: "It appears that all of our attempts to stop an uprising amongst the Socialists has unfortunately, failed. After the national populists took power in our country, this only angered the leftist radicals even more, and now various militias and workers unions have taken control of various areas throughout the country. The worst has now arrived for our nation. We must now decide how to proceed from here."
austria.9.a:0 "We cannot handle this on our own; unify with Germany!"
austria.9.b:0 "We'll put these Socialists down ourselves!"
austria.10.t:0 "Austrians request Unification"
austria.10.d:0 "Among many of our citizens, they seem to be quite apathetic towards fighting and participating in the civil war all by themselves. Many of them feel that we are too outnumbered by them, and that simply the best course of action would be to unite with the Valkist Reich, so in the end, we can secure peace and stability for the Austrian people, no matter what"
austria.10.a:0 "Accept, and we'll make an example of these Collectivist revolters."
austria.10.b:0 "Decline, Socialists are scary. Austria is on their own."
austria.11.t:0 "Mounting dissent from the Moderate-Left"
austria.11.d:0 "As the days pass, it seems it's not only the radicals who aren't satisfied with the current state of our government. Now, we are seeing an increased amount of dissent, and unrest from these specific moderate groups, which have only cause futher instability and trouble for us."
austria.11.a:0 "Concerning."
austria.12.t:0 "Industrialization of Austria"
austria.12.d:0 "Recently, we have seen an increasing amounts of threats from countries around us, such as Germany and Hungary. Many citizens and politicians alike think that we should, for the time being, invest the good number of our resources into the industry in order to both increase our nations prosperity, as well as security. However, there are some other politicians, who believe that the money could be better spent elsewhere, like our military, or various other projects. Should we risk angering this small minority of politicians?"
austria.12.a:0 "Pass the Act."
austria.12.b:0 "That's unnessecary and controversial."
austria.13.t:0 "Unrest in the countryside"
austria.13.d:0 "As the days are passing bye, things are not getting much better for Austria. The amount of political unrest has gone from not only the cities, but to the countryside and various rural areas as well. It seems that in this time, no Austrian, regardless of wealth, status, or location, is safe from the conflict."
austria.13.a:0 "Not much can be done about that, unfortunately."
austria.14.t:0 "Heimwehr gains traction"
austria.14.d:0 "Among the new political crisis that is occuring within our country, an old enemy has come back strong. The old conservative paramilitary organisation, the Heimwehr, has come back, stronger and more popular then ever. It's status as a reactionary, paramilitary organisation, has for the longest time been a threat to our government. But now, this is even more the case. With their increase popularity and power, we must tread carefully."
austria.14.a:0 "We cannot let Reactionary Dogs challenge us! Crush them!"
austria.15.t:0 "Heimwehr storms the Federal Council!"
austria.15.d:0 "Terror has struck today! The Heimwehr has, for the longest time, been the biggest of threats to us, and our attempts to drive them out have been highly unsuccessful. However, the worst has come, as today, they have stormed and taken control of our Federal Council. We are unsure of what will happen next, but we are sure it won't be pretty..."
austria.15.a:0 "I am the Federal Council!"
austria.16.t:0 "The Austrian Civil War"
austria.16.d:0 "After the Heimwehr seized power in Austria, it caused a brief, but big enough opportunity for the leftist parties to rise up in opposition to what would become the new, reactionary government. The Heimwehr now stands at a crossroads as to what actions it should take. "
austria.16.a:0 "The Heimwehr attempts to Unify with Germany!"
austria.16.b:0 "The Heimwehr decides to fight by themselves!"
austria.17.t:0 "Skirmishes with the Heimwehr"
austria.17.d:0 "In an attempt to put an end to this paramilitary organization, we have deployed our armed forces in area where we have noticed high amounts of Heimwehr activity. Unfortunately for us, these engagements have ended in severe disaster for us, and our government has lost support due to the amount of lives lost in these fatal engagements."
austria.17.a:0 "Blast!"
austria.18.t:0 "Cracking down on the Heimwehr & Valkists"
austria.18.t:0 "After we have finally secured our government, we must at last put an end to the few that remain of the reactionary forces. No longer shall they try to stop the plight of the working man, and hold back the nation of Austria."
austria.18.a:0 "This surely won't result in any repercussions."
austria.19.t:0 "Purging the Social-Nationalists"
austria.19.d:0 "The Reactionaries, are, however, not the only threat to our government. The radical elements and nationalists of Austria could become even more and more dangerous, if left unchecked, and could cause increasing instability for us in the future. We must rid them from our cabinet, so this will never happen to us."
austria.19.a:0 "The radicals must be put down!"
austria.20.t:0 "Purging the Austro-Marxists"
austria.20.d:0 "Even within our own faction, we see constant infighting. We are all Socialists, but alas, we aren't united in solidarity. Many of them hold different beliefs in how to carry out an economy that is best suited for the proletariat, and the Austro-Marxists are certainly examples of this. In order to create the ideal society in our image, they must be removed."
austria.20.a:0 "The radicals must be put down!"
austria.21.t:0 "Heimwehr riots across the nation!"
austria.21.d:0 "Damn the Heimwehr! It appears that even after our purges, there were some clever remnants who managed to elude us. Now, they have re-organized, and have gained more and more popularity. They have now inspired mass riots across all of Austria!"
austria.21.a:0 "Oh god how awful how could I have anticipated dissent from the people I purged, that's crazy"
austria.22.t:0 "Austria in Disarray"
austria.22.d:0 "Riots have broken out all across our fallen brother, Austria. This would be an opportune moment to intervene and unite our nations as they were always meant to be."
austria.22.a:0 "Intervene and attempt to occupy Austria."
austria.22.b:0 "We cannot risk angering the Entente."
austria.23.t:0 "German forces move into Austria!"
austria.23.d:0 "We've just received reports that German forces have moved across the Danube. Under normal circumstances this would mean war, but we are in a most dire situation. Perhaps surrendering would be the best option?"
austria.23.a:0 "We cannot resist... We are broken..."
austria.23.b:0 "If they want our land, they'll have to fight us!"
austria.24.t:0 "Successful occupation"
austria.24.d:0 "Austria has successfully been secured! People all around the country now hail Dressler as their "Führer" and sing praises to the Fatherland."
austria.24.a:0 "We are one step closer to Uniting the German people!"
austria.25.t:0 "Austrian resistance!"
austria.25.d:0 "The Austrians have decided that they would rather face German steel than surrender. They hold a strong defensive position in the Alps, but surely this wouldn't be enough to stop the onslaught of the German army."
austria.25.a:0 "Crush the Austrians! This means WAR!"
austria.25.b:0 "Withdraw our troops! Call off the operation!"
austria.26.t:0 "Negotiating with the Valkists"
austria.27.d:0 "We have decided to start negotiations with the Valkists. During these negotiations it will be crucial to gain a mutual understanding of what the future should hold for our nation."
austria.26.a:0 "Only through understanding can differences be settled."
austria.27.t:0 "Cracking down on the Austromarxists"
austria.27.d:0 "We have recently deployed the Heimwehr to various known hiding places for the Austromarxists. We will no longer tolerate these leeches feeding off of our great nation!"
austria.27.a:0 "I was lying about being understanding to the opposition."
austria.28.t:0 "Status of the Heimwehr"
austria.28.d:0 "The Heimwehr was created to keep order and serve as a standing army in case of emergency. However, it is time to decide whether it should serve a greater purpose than this."
austria.28.a:0 "The Heimwehr is designated as the National Police Force."
austria.28.b:0 "The Heimatblock gains a majority in the Coalition."
austria.28.c:0 "They Co-rule with the CSP."
austria.29.t:0 "Failed Valkist Coup"
austria.29.d:0 "This morning, a convoy smuggling weapons across the border was stopped. The vehicle and crew were Germans of the Valkist Reich to our north. These men led us to a secret meeting place where various valkist conspirators were planning a Coup D'etat to take control of our nation and unite with the Germans."
austria.29.a:0 "We tried to be understanding with you..."
austria.30.t:0 "Leftist uprisings across the Nation!"
austria.30.d:0 "Early this morning, with what started a simple strike for better working conditions soon spread beyond all belief to a massive, nation-wide uprising of the left. This must be dealt with and fast."
austria.30.a:0 "Blast!"
austria.31.t:0 "The Austrian Civil War"
austria.31.d:0 "With our country on the brink of total collapse, perhaps it would be wise to consider the option of unifying with Germany. Their strength would surely bring stability to our nation."
austria.31.a:0 "We cannot handle this on our own; unify with Germany!"
austria.31.b:0 "There is no need."
