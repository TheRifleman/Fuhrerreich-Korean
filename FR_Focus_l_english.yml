### Generic Focuses ###
generic_army_effort:0 "Modern Warfare"
generic_army_effort_desc:0 "The Great War, from its start to its end, changed warfare forever by finally ending Napoleonic Warfare's grasp on military thought and confirming the extreme deadliness of the rifle, machine gun and artillery cannon. Our army must adapt or perish, in a literal sense."
generic_equipment_effort:0 "Equipment Modernisation"
generic_equipment_effort_desc:0 "For a long time, military breakthroughs were slow, and having a good bolt-action rifle was enough. However, these rifles of the 19th Century are completely out of place on post-Great War battlefield. We must stop being complacent and get new equipment."
generic_motorization_effort:0 "Army Motorisation"
generic_motorization_effort_desc:0 "The cavalry charges of the Great War were probably the last. The truck is no longer just a transport tool and rapidly integrates to mobile warfare tactics. We must shake off outdated thinking and use motorisation to speed up our offensives and reinforcements."
generic_doctrine_effort:0 "Studying the Great War"
generic_doctrine_effort_desc:0 "We know about the Great War, but what have we learned from it? In just five years of conflict, countless soldiers died to teach us the new dynamics of warfare. If we do not learn about them, then our soldiers will meet the same fate on the battlefield."
generic_equipment_effort_2:0 "Equipment Research"
generic_equipment_effort_2_desc:0 "We might have caught up to modern equipment, but new designs are already making ours obsolete. Regardless, we must persevere, and make sure that we never fall a single year behind in equipment. This means we will have to start developing our own designs."
generic_mechanization_effort:0 "Mechanised Warfare"
generic_mechanization_effort_desc:0 "Trucks fared poorly on the frontlines, but it seems that we can now meet halfway between trucks and tanks. Armoured personal carriers can bring troops directly into combat, shield them from fire, and even provide powerful fire support if needed."
generic_doctrine_effort_2:0 "Military Exercises"
generic_doctrine_effort_2_desc:0 "Every great power exercises, and so should we. War games are more than peacetime entertainment for generals, they allow us to test both true and tested and revolutionary tactics without wasting countless lives. This allows us to complete our theoretical discoveries."
generic_doctrine_effort_3:0 "Wargames"
generic_doctrine_effort_3_desc:0 "By enacting 'pretend' battles we are able to simulate war-like scenarios without actually being at war. This will allow our officers to get a breath of Fresh air in terms of Military Tactics"
generic_equipment_effort_3:0 "Equipment Breakthroughs"
generic_equipment_effort_3_desc:0 "We have come to such an experience in equipment research that we are no longer limited to eternally catching up or buying foreign equipment to get cutting-edge military gear. Even great powers may soon be surprised by what will soon be in our soldiers' hands."
generic_armor_effort:0 "Armoured Warfare"
generic_armor_effort_desc:0 "Tanks are the pinnacle of modern warfare. Mobile vehicles armed with cannons worthy of artillery, and impervious to the average rifle. Even if we only produce few, we will plow through our enemies with judicious use of those steel behemoths."
generic_special_forces:0 "Special Forces"
generic_special_forces_desc:0 "Special Forces are more than the Elite Units of old. With modern equipment, even a conscript can hold his own on the battlefield. However, some situations are so hostile that they need specially trained men. Mountain ranges, amphibious landings, airborne assaults."
generic_soldier_effort:0 "Prioritize the Soldier"
generic_soldier_effort_desc:0 "The Soldier is the core of any Army. It is only natural we focus on them instead of the Officers."
generic_officer_effort:0 "Prioritize the Officer"
generic_officer_effort_desc:0 "There are men who follow, and there are men who lead. When a man has nobody to follow, what will he do? He will have to take the mantle up himself, at attempt to lead despite not knowing how to do so. Such a thing can never be allowed to happen, we must ensure our officers are capable of leading."
generic_arms_imports:0 "Arms Imports"
generic_arms_imports_desc:0 "It is evident that we will need assistance in equiping our Army, perhaps we should import a shipment of Arms from one of the major powers?"
generic_recruitment:0 "Glorify the Soldier"
generic_recruitment_desc:0 "A main reason that people turn away from the military is that they see too much pain for too little gain. We should glorify the Soldier, to such a point where fervour overtakes the citizens and they no longer turn away."
generic_reform_officer_corps:0 "Reform our Officer Corps"
generic_reform_officer_corps_desc:0 "In these rapidly changing times of warfare, we must ensure that our Officer Corps are completely up-to-date."
generic_reform_supply_lines:0 "Modern Supply Lines"
generic_reform_supply_lines_desc:0 "The Era of horse-towed supply-lines is no more. We must ensure that we use every edge we can get in supply transport. We will utilise trucks and planes, anything, as long as it is more efficient than our current system."
generic_national_training_school:0 "National Training School"
generic_national_training_school_desc:0 "By setting up a national training school; we can ensure new officers are getting top-notch training."
generic_mil_industrial_complex:0 "Military-Industrial Complex"
generic_mil_industrial_complex_desc:0 "According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible."

generic_aviation_effort:0 "National Airforce"
generic_aviation_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YAir Base§!"
generic_aviation_effort_desc:0 "The field of aviation was born almost in time for the Great War. Even two decades after this war, it is still new, and all nations strive to be ready for the next time their planes may be called to war. We must, too. We must found a solid Airforce to organise them."
generic_fighter_focus:0 "Air Superiority"
generic_fighter_focus_desc:0 "The dogfights of the Great War were merely the start of air-to-air warfare. As planes become faster, more armoured and more heavily armed, we need to put all our efforts into making sure we control the air. Then, striking the ground is a formality."
generic_bomber_focus:0 "Strategic Bombing"
generic_bomber_focus_desc:0 "Even when they were brand new, bombers inspired fear, and many saw their potential. As payloads get larger and bigger, even the artillery barrages of the Great War fail to compare. Some day, we may even surpass them, and destroy entire cities or regions in one run."
generic_aviation_effort_2:0 "Modern Air Tactics"
generic_aviation_effort_2_desc:0 "Planes have long stopped being just reconnaissance and harassment tools. By integrating them fully into our army operations, the airforce is capable of dealing as much damage and advancing our operations as much as the average Army Command."
generic_CAS_effort:0 "Close Air Support"
generic_CAS_effort_desc:0 "While Fighters and Bombers can indirectly affect the battle, dedicated CAS planes have both the agility and armament needed to perform strafe and bombing runs on ground targets, causing major damage on unprepared armies while handling decently in aerial combat."
generic_rocket_effort:0 "Experimental Rocketry"
generic_rocket_effort_desc:0 "The field of rocketry is perhaps one of the newest fields of military science. If our scientists are to be believed, rocket engines can achieve speeds that would put radial engines to shame. Some say they could go even faster than sound, certainly extremely exciting."
generic_NAV_effort:0 "Naval Aviation"
generic_NAV_effort_desc:0 "Perhaps one of the major breakthroughs in naval warfare, naval bombers are able to lay waste on enemy fleets with torpedoes and other dedicated naval payloads like mines. Supporting our fleets, they can challenge capital ships and wreck havoc in the naval screens."

generic_naval_effort:0 "Modern Dockyards"
generic_naval_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YNaval Dockyards§!"
generic_naval_effort_desc:0 "If we are to establish a strong navy, we need to produce it first. Shipbuilding methods have evolved, and old drydocks need to be upgraded as much as new dockyards must be built from scratch. The modern ship is no cog, and we must see big to have a sea-worthy fleet."
generic_flexible_navy:0 "Flexible Tactics"
generic_flexible_navy_desc:0 "We will never have the navies of the world powers, able to clean entire seas of opposition, but this does not mean our fleet will hide in port. Using flexible tactics and modern inventions like submarines, we do not need to actually match up with those grand fleets to wreck havoc."
generic_large_navy:0 "Power Projection"
generic_large_navy_desc:0 "Our navy might not yet be able to contest the bigger navies of this world, but by picking our fights smartly and keeping our fleets focused, we can make sure that any confrontation is in our advantage while still retaining a powerful navy that can rout weaker navies."
generic_submarine_effort:0 "Submarine Warfare"
generic_submarine_effort_desc:0 "Submarine warfare is the most exciting naval development since the invention of the torpedo boat, and challenges even the most classical doctrines of naval warfare. We would do well to not just protect against submarines, but also use them against enemy ships."
generic_cruiser_effort:0 "Screen Ships"
generic_cruiser_effort_desc:0 "Cruisers are not just 'cheap Battleships', and such outdated thinking ruins the potential of those ships. We should use them as escorts to our capital ships, as they are very vulnerable to naval bombers and smaller ships like torpedo boats."
generic_destroyer_effort:0 "Anti-Submarine Warfare"
generic_destroyer_effort_desc:0 "By studying the design and strategic use of submarines, we also learn how to counter them. Our Destroyers will need specialised equipment like depth charges and specific designs that are both light and small to ensure they can escort convoys and patrol efficiently."
generic_capital_ships_effort:0 "Capital Ships"
generic_capital_ships_effort_desc:0 "Eventually, a fleet is nothing without a centrepiece, and both the old Battleship and modern Carrier fit this role. While vulnerable in a direct confrontation, they can bring massive damage upon enemy fleets if we let them shell and swarm the enemy ships from a safe distance."

generic_industrial_effort:0 "Industrial Methods"
generic_industrial_effort_desc:0 "To construct a large industrial base, we will need to set up the basics of modern industry, and maybe even make initial choices. Concentrated or dispersed industrial centres, investing in machine tools and construction tools. All of those are important things to focus on."
generic_construction_effort:0 "Industrial Grants"
generic_construction_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YCivilian Factories§!"
generic_construction_effort_desc:0 "A healthy and strong industry doesn't just appear out of nowhere. While we may have to start more ambitious projects later, we must start by ensuring that those with good management skills can start healthy, successful companies that may later grow into giants."
generic_production_effort:0 "State Armouries"
generic_production_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YMilitary Factory§!"
generic_production_effort_desc:0 "Until we are able to produce our own military equipment, we should create modern armouries for our army. Their goal is quite modest, procuring the gear our army needs using state funds, civilian production and simple production, but it is better than not getting any new rifles."
generic_construction_effort_2:0 "Industrial Centres"
generic_construction_effort_2_desc:0 "Entrepreneurship is one thing, but to have an economy worthy of even a regional power, we will need to foster the large industrial regions that made the Industrial Revolution. The seeds of such regions are large investment into promising industrial sites."
generic_production_effort_2:0 "Military Manufactures"
generic_production_effort_2_desc:0 "We must produce our own military equipment if we want our army to be more than a reserve force. The only way to do so is to heavily fund the creation of dedicated military manufactures, and support them with regular contracts and promises to ensure they can stay afloat."
generic_production_effort_3:0 "Military Industry"
generic_production_effort_3_desc:0 "We have finally reached a point where we have companies able to build the equipment we need, even if their output is still limited. However, our needs are still great, and by giving them absolute support over foreign companies they will slowly scale up to our needs."
generic_infrastructure_effort:0 "National Infrastructure"
generic_infrastructure_effort_desc:0 "Our growing industry requires a solid infrastructure to ensure the transit of goods. We need to do away with chaotic, city to city planning and finally draw the roads of our country. Those who exist, those who will be expanded or linked, and those that have yet to be."
generic_infrastructure_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YInfrastructure§!"
generic_synth_oil_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YSynthetic Refinery§!"
generic_infrastructure_effort_2:0 "Railway Networks"
generic_infrastructure_effort_2_desc:0 "Modern countries need railway networks, able to bring anything from one point of the country to another rapidly and efficiently. This means we will have to expand our railways and create junctions that didn't occur to us even a few years ago."
generic_construction_effort_3:0 "Industrial Networks"
generic_construction_effort_3_desc:0 "Much like roads and railways, industries are connected in large, sprawling networks, based on input and output, import and export. As our infrastructure improves, so do these links, and our industry grows stronger as they can rely on the economy of our few wealthy provinces."

generic_extra_tech_slot:0 "Research Councils"
generic_extra_tech_slot_desc:0 "Our industrial growth has attracted many learned minds, both nationals and foreign scientists looking for employment. We should fund research councils to ensure that they find tasks to work on, until our industrial base grows enough that we attract private research institutes."
generic_extra_tech_slot_2:0 "Research Institutes"
generic_extra_tech_slot_2_desc:0 "As our industrial base expands, we finally go from just manufacturing to actually designing and creating, or at least attracting those who do. Those research institutes have not only the minds, but also the funds to make discoveries. Let us waste no time encouraging their implantation."
generic_technology_sharing:0 "Technology Sharing"
generic_technology_sharing_desc:0 "By sharing technological advances with our allies, our whole faction will be able to conduct wartime research and development more efficiently. Of course, we will need to prove our help is impactful to them, but once this much is proved, we stand to benefit greatly from their research."
generic_secret_weapons:0 "Secret Weapons"
generic_secret_weapons_desc:0 "It is tempting to expend all extra resources into just developing tanks and planes, but the secret to winning wars lies in whole new fields of science; electronics, rocketry and nuclear research. Just because we are not a major power, does not mean we cannot make our own strides in those fields."

generic_political_effort:0 "Political Reform"
generic_political_effort_desc:0 "To bring about change in the world, we need to be able to bring about change in our own country. Strengthening our political position should come first, we need to do away with old political doctrine and be ready to adopt bold, ambitious views on how our nation is to be ruled from now on."
generic_collectivist_ethos_kr:0 "Unite The Nation"
generic_collectivist_ethos_kr_desc:0 "This era is a strange one, with the rise of Communism, the fragile position of Democracy and the maintained Authoritarian old order. We must protect our country from outside influences by ensuring our people believe in the founding values of our country, least we are washed away by opposing views."
generic_militarism:0 "Militarism"
generic_militarism_desc:0 "Those who view the military as a necessary evil are doomed to hesitate in the face of war. We will ingrain militarism into our culture to become a people of soldiers, if not an army with a state. If one thing is certain since the Great War, it is that it might very well not have been The War To End War."
generic_military_youth:0 "Military Youth"
generic_military_youth_desc:0 "Organisations to promote discipline and political education of young people in our nation will foster loyalty and self-sacrifice early in a citizen's life. These core values must be learned from the most tender age, so that the next generations are ready to fight for our country."
generic_ideological_fanaticism:0 "Ideological Fanaticism"
generic_ideological_fanaticism_desc:0 "Our politically established values and goals are worth dying for as much as any ancient faith. Any follower should be prepared to face death, and those who stray better be prepared to face death. There is no middle ground in this ideological struggle of the great and small powers alike."
generic_liberty_ethos_kr:0 "Spirit Of Freedom"
generic_liberty_ethos_kr_desc:0 "Freedom is not just a happy happenstance, it is something that must be preserved against tyranny. The Great War and the rise of Communism has to many put this spirit in doubt, but no nation is too small to rekindle its flame in their governments and populaces and ward against those trying to extinguish it."
generic_rights_of_man:0 "The Rights Of Man"
generic_rights_of_man_desc:0 "The Rights Of Man is perhaps the founding act of the modern Democracy, doing away with the feudal order and ensuring equal rights for all. There have always been the odd doubts about our stance on those essential rights, and we will dispel them without ambiguity. We only stand to benefit from it."
generic_liberty_research:0 "University Grants"
generic_liberty_research_desc:0 "The modern University is a great achievement, allowing people of even modest origin to elevate themselves via higher learning. However, this requires us to fund university grants to allow such access to poorer but aspiring students. Let's make that move now, these future scholars will pay dividends."
generic_welfare:0 "Welfare Programs"
generic_welfare_desc:0 "Equality in rights and equality in education are two important milestones, but economic equality is perhaps the hardest. While we might never reach a perfect equality in this area, we can at least prop up the poorest in our country with fair welfare programs. This ought to help our consumer economy speed up, too."
generic_national_identity:0 "National Identity"
generic_national_identity_desc:0 "While the ideological debate is one we could get lost in for ages, we must not forget who we are at our core. We are unique, we know our history, our culture and we hope that our destiny is even more brilliant. If we have shaped a better society today, we will shape an even better country tomorrow."

### Generic Ideas ###
generic_liberty_idea:0 "Spirit Of Freedom"
generic_liberty_idea_desc:0 "Freedom is something we have pledged to preserve, and this inspires our population to support us even if they may not always agree with our policies or the state of the country in the present moment."
generic_militarism_focus:0 "Militarism"
generic_milstaff_focus:0 "National Training School"
generic_milstaff_focus_desc:0 "Better training, a more decentralised commmand structure and encouraging innovative Military though will allow our Officer Corps to act at peak efficiency."
generic_reformsupply_focus:0 "New Supply Systems"
generic_recruitment_focus:0 "Recruitment Campaign"
generic_recruitment_focus_desc:0 "A nationalistic sentiment coupled with the glorification of the Standard Soldier has lead to an influx of recruits in our military."
generic_militarism_focus_desc:0 "Our people have come to see the army as an integral part of our nation, and every conscript plays his part. This allows us to mobilise reserves, militia and other paramilitary forces in a pinch."
generic_military_youth_focus:0 "Military Youth"
generic_military_youth_focus_desc:0 "From the youngest age, our citizens learn military values and integrate them as a part of their life. This obviously increases the amount of vocations for the army as they reach adulthood."
generic_ideological_fanaticism_focus:0 "Ideological Fanaticism"
generic_ideological_fanaticism_focus_desc:0 "Our country is the centre of our ideology, and our ideology is the fabric of country. Many are ready to die for its survival when others would easily retreat to new positions."
generic_liberty_research_idea:0 "University Grants"
generic_liberty_research_idea_desc:0 "We are paying modest but still relatively decent university grants to ensure any aspiring student has a shot at higher education. This is bound to increase the size of our intelligentsia"
generic_welfare_idea:0 "Welfare Programs"
generic_welfare_idea_desc:0 "We are ensuring that the poorest in our society receive the help they need to survive, so that they do not have to fend for themselves and may work for our economy one day."
generic_arms_payments:0 "Arms Payments"

### Bonuses ###
naval_doctrine_bonus:0 "Floating Airfield Doctrine"

### Generic Events ###
genfocus.1.t:0 "Who should we import from?"
genfocus.1.d:0 "After our Nation's recent descision to Import arms from another country, we have been stumped on a very important question. Who will we import the Arms from? Purchasing from the Soviets would net us the largest portion of weapons, however they would be outdated for the most part. Purchasing from the British or French would grant us a sizable amount of arms, at a reasonable quality. Purchasing arms from the Germans would enable us to purchase a lower amount of higher quality weaponry. But the question remains, who shall we import from?"
genfocus.2.t:0 "Recent Arms Sale"
genfocus.2.d:0 "It seems that we have recently made an Arms sale! [From.GetName] has purchased a shipment of arms from us, which is en-route to their location right now. These arms weren't in-use by our military; so this won't impact our stored arms. For the moment, we're raking in funds from this sale."
