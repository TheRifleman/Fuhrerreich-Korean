Ina  surprising turn of events, he then turned to the royal palace, and proceeded to proclaim himself 'King of the Romanians' in an ad-hoc ceremony surrounded by rubble and tanks. Whether or not King Michael made it out alive is not known, however several aircraft were seen taking off from a nearby airport heading south towards the Danube.
