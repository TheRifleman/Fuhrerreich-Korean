ITA_FUHRERREICH_DESC: "이탈리아는 대전쟁 이후 두배의 가까운 새로운 영토와 고토를 수복함으로써 신흥국가로써 부상했습니다. 그러나 그 이후의 상황은 좋지 않았습니다, 전쟁은 우리의 경제에 타격을 주었고 혼란속에서 노동자들은 파업을 했습니다. 혼란은 1923년 시인 단눈지오가 쿠데타를 실패할때까지 유지되었습니다, 이러한 사건들후에 정부는 긴축되었으며 왕은 퇴위하였습니다. 오늘날 이탈리아는 거의 안정되었지만 세계에 영향을 미치는 바람이 언제 들이닥칠지 모릅니다...."

italy.0.t:0 "이탈리아 왕국"
italy.0.d:0 "After winning the Great War, Italy, had regained the long dreamed Terre Irredente of Dalmatia, Trentino, and Istria, plus some colonial concessions. Although the war was a diplomatic success, the same thing can't be said about the economic situation. The Italian economy wasn't ready for the war and the military industry wasn't developed enough, so during the first year of conflict, thousands of people fought with only feather caps and knives, the government realised the situation was horrible so a lot of factories were shut down and then transformed into ammo- and rifle factories. So, when the war was over and the workers returned to the factories there was no work. People were also promised money for fighting in the war, but those were never received by the soldiers. In this climate of anger and delusion workers decided to take their opportunity and occupy the factories. The 'Biennio' Rosso had started. In reaction to this attempted revolution, squads of Great War veterans and nationalists in general formed up to fight the red menace, workers occupied and held good chunks of land until 1923, when the pro-government and nationalists forces succeeded in taking it. Following the glory, war veteran, poet, and writer D'Annunzio, who led the squads until that moment, decided it was the moment to overthrow the monarchy, thousands of Legionnaires stormed all the major cities of Italy, failing in some and succeeding in others, while the main group entered the parliament, the action was stopped by the Regio Esercito and D'Annunzio arranged a flight to Fiume, were he had an established headquarter and tried another time but he was instantly chased off by the local police platoon. In the following days all the conspiracy theorists were arrested and an austerity government called. The austerity government headed by Ivanoe Bonomi, started a number of reforms, starting with the concession of workers' rights and ending with a reform of the judiciary system and thus the amnesty for all the Legionnaires and Revolutionairies that fought between 1921-1923 during the Biennium. In 1926, liberal King Vittorio Emanuele III, deluded of the end of his reign, feeling guilty of the chaotic Biennium and scared of a comeback of the communists, abdicated in favour of his son, Umberto II di Savoia. Today, Italy has almost recovered, but major change on a global scale could revive one decade old memories and anger the far-left opposition, that has been still strong to this day.... \n\nJumping to 1936, liberals, now led by Luigi Einaudi, still remain the largest party in parliament but not a majority. Their government is unpopular and unable to get much done. The 1936 parliamentary election is looking to be one of the most defining in Italian history. The liberals are opposed by three other coalitions. The centre-left social democrats, the christian conservatives and the far-left communists. While it looks like the social democrats have the best chance of gaining a majority against the liberals, in a quickly changing world it could be anyone's race"

Despite this leftist sentiments have become increasingly popular among the citizens and within parliament. This Election is expected to be an intense fight between the Unione Socialista coalition led by the Social Democrat candidate Giuseppe Saragat and between the Liberal party led by current president of the council Luigi Einaudi, but in the wake of the LSMC a comeback for the more extreme factions in Italian politics, the leftist Partito Socialista or the right wing Partito Popolare is quite possible."

Palmiro Togliatti of the Communist Party alternatively stated that the Italian nation should leave the reactionary Entente and instead should align itself with the Soviet Union however his statement was not supported by the more moderate Socialist party or by the Social Democratic Party.

The war had weakened our nation's economy and in response many unions initiated strikes. While the 'Worker's Councils' claim these strikes had the goal of improving the living standards of the average worker it was clear they were inspired by the revolution in Russia and were willing to do anything to bring Communism to our country. This unrest severely weakened Italy and the ruling government was too feeble to effectively respond. Under the leadership of National Syndicalist and Great War veteran Benito Mussolini, who until 1921 fought alongside the Workers, legions of patriots known as 'Black Shirts' took to the streets of Italy to fight back against the wave of insurrection, from both left and right. Mussolini believed that the Nation shouldn't have fallen neither to the Communist Beasts, that would have let the nation become a Satelite of the USSR, neither to the reactionairies, that would have weakened the Nation with their ideas. This violence was successful in many cases but it was not without its causalities. In 1925 Mussolini was shot and killed by a communist sympathizer while leading his followers to break up a Union protest . This severely weakened the Black Shirt, that without Mussolini started to align itself with D'Annunzio's Squads,  in 1926 the Liberal government ended the compromise and of the Black Shirts there was nothing left. Mussolini's impressive oratory skills and 'strongman' philosophy had inspired many especially Il Duce Italo Balbo who's government is highly built upon his rhetoric. We must remember Benito Mussolini for being a Forefather of the modern, stronger, Latin nation."

The spirit of the Duke of Victory Armando Diaz, whom passed away in 1928, is still living strong in the army and thanks to him Italian soldiers are no longer under equipped but this has also lead to complacency within the commanding officers which may weaken are ability to defend ourselves. Earlier attempts at modernization began when Italy started purchasing tanks from Britain in 1928 which has helped the Italian war industry advance quite significantly. FIAT is pushing for the implementation of newer, home built, tanks into the army so we can spare our soldiers the unprotected slaughter they were subjected to in the Great War but some officers believe that the one major reason for the Italian army's poor performance in that war was due to the lack of sufficient artillery. Instead of focusing on expensive and vulnerable tanks they think we should make sure our soldiers have advanced and powerful artillery to support their attacks. In Rome, collectivist politicians have influenced some army leaders to integrate the paramilitary/partisan Red Brigades into the army and push for the implementation of mass conscription and partisan warfare while the more conservative elements of parliament wish to give more autonomy to officers and generals who wish to create a strong, well trained and well equiped professional army spearheaded by powerful “Alpini” mountaineer divisions who are a great source of pride for the Italian Nation."

Now if we want to recover quick and not fall to another Red revolution we must decide where and how to develop our industry. The natural options are the rural south and our new acquisitions such as Dalmatia. The southern regions or “Mezzogiorno” have a long history of being culturally and economically separated from the North. The south was once a monarchy ruled by a Bourbon, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, which in 1861 fell under Savoyard occupation during the Italian Risorgimento. During the first year of integration a concept of Piedmontisation was established in the whole Italian peninsula. Most politicians never cared much of the southern region and instead developed the North, that led to the creation of crime organizations like Cosa Nostra or 'Ndrangheta and to a lower standard of living than compared to Northern Italy. A new economic program centered on the "Mezzogiorno" will pacify the harsh relations with the local population but could lead to a "war" with the crime's families that are in control of rural Sicily.Dalmatia has only been Italian since the end of the Great War, before then it was Austrian, Venetian and Croatian. Dalmatia is the long-lost land symbol of Italian Nationalism and Austrian greed. Poets like Gabriele D'Annunzio talked about the beauty of that land and even Dante recognized it as the frontier of the Italian State. Hundreds of thousands of Soldiers died for this land and now that it's in the right hands we should bring it back to their golden age during the Venetian era. Since the acquisition of the region by the Austrians under the Treaty of Campoformio the area has been severly ignored. Moving the Italian economic center to this region could favor immigration to the coast and the development of the new ports like the pearl of Dalmatia, Ragusa or the rose of the Adriatic, Trieste."

At this moment the most prominent faction have always been the Left Communist wing, which has been in power since the 1936 Italian election but two new factions are forming, the Vanguardist wing led by charismatic leader Palmiro Togliatti, the Socialist Agrarian Party led by Giacomo Matteotti and a small Anarchist Faction. Though small now a reshuffle of the cabinet may lead to these parties gaining more influence within Italy."
italy.86.d:0 "Since from Risorgimento, Anarchists circles have always been popular in the Italian underground, with people like influential anarchist Errico Malatesta being born in this nation and Anarchists Magazines being sold in local newsstands. Now that Italy is ruled by a Communist government anarchists factions even hold places in Congress but many politicians don't like that. Anarchism is seen by many Communist Congressman as a flawed deviation from Classical Marxism and they'd prefer to not see their influence in Congress. Other people instead think that their participation to the revolution should be respected. Even though the anarchist faction will never reach a majority in the current government, action is needed to settle this debate."
italy.87.d:0 "Now that Comrade Gramsci has resigned, long time member and left communist politician, Amadeo Bordiga, has taken control of the Congress until a new government can be formed. Bordiga has been an influence on Gramsci his entire political life. Many saw him as paternal figure to the Chairman. Gramsci has always been in weak health and was seen by his critics as not suitable to lead a revolution, only Bordiga's influence kept him strong during these harsh times. Now that Gramsci's gone, Bordiga is left with no sympathies within the party. He has always been sidelined by his fellow communists. His anti-opportunists and left views have created many enemies inside the party. If any non-Gramscist wing ever come to power he knows that his political influence will come to and end..."

italy.89.d:0 "Due to increasing pressure from the new radical government now in control of Italy, King Umberto II has chosen to flee the nation. When he and his family landed in Portugal he told the local press 'I think back to my last hours in Rome, With freedom everything is possible, without freedom everything is lost but now I fear the worst for the Italian people. I have failed them and this will be a shame I'll carry for the rest of my life'. Back in Italy though few tears were cried for the former king. The new administration is currently taking control of the power vacuum left by Umberto II and now controls all of Italy unopposed."
italy.90.d:0 "The recent Italian election has seen the Collectivist Party, lead by Socialist politician Antonio Gramsci, rise to power. The Socialists are now the largest party in Italy and socialists make up a majority of government positions. This is a huge victory for the workers of Italy and we should congratulate Gramsci on his paty's success."
italy.91.d:0 "Antonio Gramsci, once an outsider in the politics of Italy, has become Prime Minister of Italy. Socialism is a degenerate ideology and seeks to undermine the stability of Albania. In these extraordinary times it may be best for us to distance ourselves from the failing Italian state."
italy.912.d:0 "The Albanian state controlled by the italian tyrant Ferdinand I has cut ties with Italy. His government cliams that this action is to protect Albanians from the unrest in Italy. Whatever excuse they come up with, it doesn't matter. We will return to Albania as liberators."
italy.92.d:0 "Ferdinand I has been ousted out of power. Our dedicated forces were easily able to depose the former puppet ruler and his forces without much hassle but now we must decide the path of Albania. Our government is split between two postions. On one side many want to return Albania to a civillian government as soon as possible and allow local Marxists implement and develop socialism and on the other side some argue that we should continue our occupation of Albania and assist in the development of Socialism directly."
italy.93.d:0 "The Italian collectivist have been planning our downfall ever since our independence. "
italy.94.d:0 "Albania's position in the Adriatic makes it a key strategic region for Italy. Who ever controls Albania controls access to the Adricatic. After the Great War Albania was granted to Italy and placed into there Sphere of Influence under the rule of Ferdinand I. Debates over Abanian autonomy have raged on for years but now it seems Rome has plans to settle the issue for good. Italy has officially announced Albania as the newest Region of the kingdom and will administer it as such. This announcement has recived mixed support in our own government however. Many Italian buisness men support the annexation caliming it would help develop our rural nation's economy but many nationalists still remember the sacrifices of the Albanians who fought against the Ottomans only 30 years ago. Never again should we fall under the boot of a foreign power."
italy.95.d:0 "Ever since the Great War concluded the foreign policy of Albania has been handled by Rome. Now though Italy has offered to promote our nation to become an official member of the Entente, giving us a sway in there policies. While this would bring us much pretige and influence many of our ministers still prefer to seek a neutral foreign policy."
italy.952.d:0 "Albania has agreed to join the Entente as an official participating member, gaining the influence and reposibility that comes along with it."
italy.953.d:0 "Albania has choosen to continue there neutral foreign policy. We will continue to offer protection to there nation despite this."
italy.96.d:0 "The recent coup in Rome has brought Italo Balbo, a strong visionary nationalist, to power. His goal and philosophy matches ours very well to the point that he has offered an alliance with our nation to help unite Spain. In troubled times like this those with strength and goals must unite to see there destiny achieved but many conservative officials argue that Balbo is taking advantage of our weakness to gain influence over the politics of Spain."
italy.962.d:0 "The Falangist have accepted our propsal for an alliance. Our armies are already preparing to land in Spain and support the Falangist war effort."
italy.97.d:0 "The blind politicians in Falangist Spain have refused our alliance. If we truly want influence of Spain however we shouldn't waste time supporting a weak regime, we should directly intevene and bring the glory of Roman arms to the Spanish nation."
italy.98.d:0 "The government of Rome has sent us an ultimatum demanding that we submit to there foreign policy goals. In return Italy will provide us protection and economic support. This demand has been rejected by many ministers in our government as an obvious attack against our sovereignty but some anti-British politicians argue that our two mediterranean nations share similar goals and interests and that together we can rid ourselves of harmful British influence."
italy.982.d:0 "With the backing of Italy the government of Greece has annuled the London Naval Treaty. They have already dismissed many British nationals from there country. Despite our support for there nation in the Great War it seems that the Greeks are now choosing to distance themselves from us. Italy has been a thorn in our side for years now. We must fight any more attempts to from the Italians to usurp our influence in the Mediterranean."
italy.99.d:0 "The Greek foreign minister has dismissed our ultimatum and has reafirmed it's support for the United Kingdom. Clearly no peaceful union of our states can occur under these circumstances. We may have to intervene directly into Greece to spread our influence but we must be wary of any possible British reaction to this."
italy.100.d:0 "Italy has been paramount in our unification of Spain. Thousands of Italians and Spanish fought together to help secure our nation but now Rome seeks repayment for it's involvement. They demand we transfer the Balearic Islands to them. These islands hold great strategic importance and are key for control of the Medditereanan. We should keep this in mind before we make a final decision."
italy.101.d:0 "Despite our support for there cause, The Falangist regime refuses to give us a fare repayment. The Balearic will remain Spanish and we will need to look for other bases if we are to continue expanding our influence in the Mediterranean."
italy.102.d:0 "To repay us for our support of their cause, the Falangist regime has agreed to transfer over the Balearic Islands. This will allow us to better protect our nations from any Medditereanan threat."
italy.103.d:0 "Italy has offered to accept us into the Entente Cordial. Many anti-British politicians see this as a great oportunity to rid our nation of British influence but many others are skeptical of Italy and Framce's ability to protect our nation."
italy.1032.d:0 "After days of negotiantions the government in Athens has agreed to join the Entente. With the gorowing threat of Germany looking to consume most of Europe, unity between our fellow democracies is desperatly needed."
italy.104.d:0 "Greece has refused to join the Entente, instead preferring to maintain there relationship with the British. Our attempt to spread Entente influence into the Meddetereanan was clearly misguided."
italy.105.d:0 "Italy, the main power of the Meddetereanan, has demanded control over the Suez Canal and various other ports in the region. Conflict over Italian and British influence in the Meddetereanan have been growing for decades but now it seems that Italy is looking to settle the issue at any cost. The Royal Navy has many commitments across the globe and and our current Meddetereanan Fleet is unprepared for a conflict against the Italian Navy. It will take weeks to organize a dfense against Italy which we may not have. Surrenderring these mostly insignificant territories may save the rest of our Meddetereanan positions."
italy.106.d:0 "To many it seemed that war between Britian and Italy was unavoidable but today both sides have made a peaceful agrrement. The United Kingdom will transfer sovereignty of the Suez canal and several other naval bases to the Kingdom of Italy. Though this move was hugely unpopular with the some in Britian, many more are releaved to see there nation remain at peace. \n\nIn Rome the people cheer on as Il Duce Italo Balbo gives a speech declaring victory over the cowardly British."
italy.107.d:0 "The United Kingdom has refused our demands. Currently our position in the Meddetereanan is stronger than Britian's but we must act fast to secure this. Quick strikes one Gibraltor and Suez would bring this conflict to a quick end but failiure to do so could drag this into a brutal and prolonged war."
italy.108.d:0 "Our war with Italy has been one set back after another. It has become clear to most within the British High Command that a victory against the Italian Army is unlikly. Many ministers have demanded that our nation seeks peace with Italy but such a loss of prestige could jeprodize our entire global empire."
italy.109.d:0 "The United Kingdom has come to us to sue for peace. They are willing to end this conflict on terms that completly surpass our original ones. Not only would we recieve our Meddetereanan ports but also Egypt aswell as British possesions in the middle east."
italy.110.d:0 "Despite our generous offer to Italy, Rome has refused our consessions for peace. We must now use the strength of our entire empire to overcome Italy."
italy.111.d:0 "History repeats itself once again as Italy demands that we submit to there authority. Under the Itlain ultimatum we would become a protectorate within the Italin Empire. While some argue that Italy could help modernize our nation this sentiment is not popular with most of our citisens. Despite the seemingly overwhelming stregth of Italy we will push back any attempt on our sovereignty."
italy.112.d:0 "It was wishful thinking to expect Abyssinia to just surrednder through ultimatum alone. Addis Ababa has ignored our words and now must be persuaded on the battlefield. We shall avenge our previous failiure and secure our position in East Africa."
italy.113.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events our delegates in Addis Ababa have reported that the government of Haile Selassie has agreed to become our protectorate. This will expand our influence in East Africa while also providning economic development to Ethiopia."
italy.114.d:0 "Our comrades in Italy have recently been elected as a majority in the Italian Parliament. With the government under there control they now seek to help secure the liberation of the Spanish worker. They seek to form an official alliance with our movement to help spread the Revolution. While this help us win the war some polititions worry that we may become too dependant on Italy for survival."
italy.115.d:0 "Deespite our generous offer to help liberate the workers of Spain, The Popular Front refuses to sign any official allaince with us. If they wish to die fighting alone, so be it."
italy.116.d:0 "Fellow socialists in Italy have recently gained controlled of the government. They now seek official solidarity between the Socialist nations of Europe. An alliance between our nations would help protect the socialists socities we have created from the threat of reactionary arms while also securing our access to the mediterranean. Despite these positives though our government has several ideological disagremment with Gramsci's movement and from a pragmatic point of view our two nations are very far apart and isolated from each other making serious cooperation difficult."
italy.117.d:0 "In Moscow and Rome crowds cheer as the news is made public. Italy has joined the Third International, brigning a new era of solidarity between Italian and Russian workers."
italy.118.d:0 "The revisionists in Moscow hve refused our entry into the Third International. Now it seems that we must forge our own path towards the global liberation of the worker."
italy.119.d:0 "Panfilia has been part of the Italian Empire since the end of The Great War but in the face of this global economic depression we must tighten our belts. It has been decided that our territory in Anatolia may not be worth further investment and should be sold to save on any further loses. Now we must decide who to sell this land too though. On one hand the Greece was our ally in the Great War but the nation now has become overextended and may even soon become a threat to us. On the other hand The Ottoman Empire, despite being our enemy in the war, will surely want this land back for it is mostly inhabited by ethnic Turks and would provide access to the Meddetereanan."
italy.120.d:0 "The nation of Italy has offered to sell us the territory of Panfilia. For centuries this land has been the home of millions of Turks who were as a result of the Great War stolen from us. While our two nations have much animosity between each other we must respect Italy's choice to reconcile with us."
italy.1212.d:0 "Turkey has accepted our proposal to purchase Panfilia. Hopefully this will not only help ease relations with Turkey but also ease the economic burden off our taxpayers."
italy.121.d:0 "The nation of Italy has offered to sell us the territory of Panfilia. Until very recently this land was the home of thousands of Greeks who were brutally forced out or assimilated by the Turks. We must undo this wrong and bring Greek influence back to Panfilia."
italy.1202.d:0 "Turkey has accepted our proposal to purchase Panfilia. Hopefully this will not only help ease relations with Turkey but also ease the economic burden off our taxpayers."
italy.123.d:0 "Italian divisions stationed in Panfilia close to the Turkish border have reported fire from Turkish positions. The bombardment is reported to be extremely heavy and reinforcements may need to be called in to stabilize the situation."
italy.124.d:0 "After hours of shelling from Turkish forces, Italian defenders in Panfilia were forced back from the border and closer to the Meddetereanan coast. A final advance by Turkish troops however forced the Italians to abandon Anatolia entirely. Turkey now stands the victor in this short undeclared conflict."
italy.126.d:0 "A short skirmish between Turkish and Italian troops in Panfilia ends indecisively as both side declare victory over the other."
italy.125.d:0 "In a daring raid Turkish troops attempted to overrun the Italian garrison in Panfilia but thanks to better training and equipment the Italin forces were able to hold there ground."
italy.130.d:0 "The Panfilia issue has soured relations with Turkey ever since the end of the Great War. Now though a large build up of Turkish troops have gathered on the Panfilia border seemingly prepared to strike at any moment. We must keep our eyes open for any further developments."
italy.131.d:0 "The socialist government of Italy believes that scientific cooperation between the socialist nations of the world is the key to spreading and developing socialism. It's hard to disagree with there points but some officials worry that spreading research into the increasingly volatile Western Europe may pose a security threat towards our nation."
italy.132.d:0 "The Soviets agree to share scientific developments with us. Together we will bring progress to the workers of the world"
italy.133.d:0 "The Soviet Union has refused to share it;s scientific developments with us. Now it seems were must bring the light of scientific progress to the workers of the world on our own."
italy.134.d:0 "As the dominant power in the Mediterranean, Italy wishes to spread peace and security through the region. To accomplish this goal they have offered to send volunteers to help fight for our cause. While more men are always helpful some officials fear that Italy may be planning to gain too much influence over our nation."
italy.140.d:0 "The Croatian revolt has been raging for months now, and the Croatian population in Dalmatia has finally decided to join their traitorous brothers in arms against both Hungary and Serbia. We must now join the war against the Croatian State, and restore peace to the region once and for all."
italy.140.a:0 "The powderkeg never disappoints..."

italy.141.t:0 "Croatia wins their independence."
italy.141.d:0 "The fighting has dragged on for many long months now, and we are unable to make a significant dent in our enemies defenses. A delegation has been sent by both of our allies, asking for peace, and we must now follow suit. We cannot defeat the Croatians together, let alone by ourselves. Croatia will have their state, until the next major war allows us to reclaim our rightful territories."
italy.141.a:0 "This is a day which will live in infamy..."

italy.142.t:0 "Hungary demands Ljubljana!"
italy.142.d:0 "The Hungarian nation has taken a path of extreme expansionism, and they have decided to send us a list of demands, notably including the transfer of Ljubljana over to them. While we could almost certainly defeat the Hungarians in a war, it would cause many deaths and may harm our reputation within the European community. How shall we respond?"
italy.142.a:0 "It is a small concession for lasting peace."

italy.200.d:0 "A Terrorist attack by the Formazioni di difesa proletaria (Formations for Proletariat Defense), a newly constituted Communist Group, shocked the entire nation this Morning. A previously planted bomb, was detonated at hours 10.46, on the Headquarter of the Liberal Party killing three and injuring several members of the party. According to witnesses, the bomb, was planted yesterday night by a group of 4 young men.

The Men prepared an ambush to the police squad, when they arrived bullets were fired and after losing one man the Governmnet Forces had to retire with shame. Even after this humiliating lost we need to stand up and keep fighting those barbarians wherever there's need"
italy.203.a:0 "What a humiliating action"
italy.205.t:0 "An Armed Resistance forms"
italy.205.d:0 "The Terrorists have refused to accept talks with the Government and started a resistance on the mountains. A communicate saying that the Formazioni di Difesa Proletaria will never collaborate with the current govenment, reached the Parliament this morning. Statemen were rather sad but not surprised, but the most worrying thing is that civils are reporting groups of people carrying Red Flags and Rifles moving to the Mountains. If the situation escalates we may find ourselves in a situation worse than the one that occurred ten nearly twenty years ago, we need to take actions before they organise."

The so-called Squadre d'Azione (Action's Squads) begun to organize in all the major cities and to raid Leftists Journals.

### Generals ###
ITA_Rodolfo_Graziani_desc:0 "§GMilitary Dossier\n§GBorn:§W11 August 1882 Filettino, Italy\n§GMilitary Career:§WGraziani joined the Regio Esercito (Royal Army) in 1903 and was soon stationed in Italian Eritrea. His first taste of success came during the Italo-Turkish war where he was promoted to Captain. He would continue to command forces during the Great War where his efforts would lead him to become the youngest Colonel in the Italian Army. Following Italy's victory against the Central Powers in 1919 Graziani became very influential on the affairs of Italy's newly gained possessions. He became infamous for his willingness to use any means necessary to assert Italian dominance over the local populations. With help from the local Greeks and in Panfilia, Graziani lead a brutal suppression of Turks in the region accused of supporting the Turkish National Movement. In Italian Cameroon he defeated a short lived guerrilla movement, forcing much of the civilian population into concentration camps and burning down thousands of square miles of jungle in the process. In Italy he is seen by many as a great Pacifier but those who have been the target of his wrath call him a butcher. Graziani is deeply conservative and believes that strong and iron fisted authority is needed to solve Italy's internal problems.\n§GNotes:§W\n-Tyrannical Authoritarian\n-Unprepared for another 'Great War'\n-Politically ambitious"

### Events ###
alb.1.t:0 "The National Liberation Movement finds more rural support"
alb.1.d:0 "Despite our police force's best efforts to keep order many of our citizens in rural regions have sympathies towards the NLM cause. It's is feared that many villages in the Korab mountains may even be harboring NLM personal, giving them the food and equipment needed to harass our army. Very little has been invested into properly dealing with this crisis which will only exacerbate the issue as time progresses."
alb.1.a:0 "We must increase police presense in the Korab mountains"
alb.4.t:0 "Liberation Day parade"
alb.4.d:0 "Though originally neutral in the Great War, Albania was drawn into the conflict when Austria invaded in a so called 'Friendly Occupation'. This was soon followed by a joint French-Italo intervention into southern Albania. The war in Albania lasted until spring of 1919 when the Entente powers were able to force Austria-Hungary to retreat from Albania. The Liberation of Albania has been celebrated as a national holiday ever since the end of the Great War as a way to pay respect to the Albanian and Italian forces who's sacrifice and bravery made it possible. The annual military parade that marches through Tirana for this occasion has, in recent years, become a target of Albanian dissidents. Riots, looting and other acts of violence have become common around the parade and the local police suspect that this year will see a large Socialist presence in the area. Ferdinand has made it a tradition to lead this parade but the increase in violence has some ministers concerned over his safty. They reccomend that Ferdinand stays at his residence this year to guarantee his safty but this may lead to further loss of legitimacy for our government."

alb.5.t:0 "Liberation Day bombing, The Prince is dead"
alb.5.d:0 "Despite warnings from his security advisors the Prince Ferdinand still chose to attend this years Liberation Day parade. Despite their best efforts the security at the event were unable to stop the terror bombing that ultimatly killed the prince. The explosion caused significant damage and lead to mass panic around the streets of Tirana. It took hours to find and identify the Prince's corpse and many more to capture the terrorist responisble, a member of the National Liberation Movement. The Prince's passing has been a massive shock to the people of Albania and Italy and sits as a reminder of how divided our nation still is."
alb.5.a:0 "This has gone too far. Petition Rome for more support."
alb.6.t:0 "Liberation Day bombing"
alb.6.d:0 "Despite their best efforts the security at the event were unable to stop the terror bombing that rocked Tirana today. The explosion caused significant damage and lead to mass panic around the streets of the city. It took hours for the panic to calm and many more to capture the terrorist responisble, a member of the National Liberation Movement. This terrorist attack has been a massive shock to the people of Albania and Italy and sits as a reminder of how divided our nation still is."
alb.6.a:0 "This has gone too far. Petition Rome for more support."
alb.7.t:0 "Albania pleades for support"
alb.7.d:0 "A recent terror attack in Tirana has shown that Albanian security forces are too weak and unorginzed addequetly defend their nation. Today the Albanian ambassader in Rome petitions us to send more forces to help stabilize the country. The crisis in Albania only serves to weaken our position in the Adriatic but many ministers warn that the cost of futher intervention in Albania may out weigh any possible benefit. They insist that as long a the port city of Vlore is secure our position in the Third Shore will be as well."
alb.7.a:0 "We must send troops to help stabilize the situation."
alb.7.b:0 "We are not in a position to send anything."
alb.8.t:0 "Italy agrees to send more men"

alb.8.a:0 "We can always count on Rome."
alb.9.t:0 "Italy refuses to send additional support"
alb.9.d:0 "Despite our desperation Rome has refused to send anymore troops to our nation. This leaves our own security forces to face growing opposition on it's own."

alb.10.t:0 "Midhat Frashëri demands the government to support the Balli Kombetar"
alb.10.d:0 "Midhat Frashëri, leader of the nationalist Balli Kombetar movement, has come to us to sign an agreement. For years the Balli Kombetar have fought Italian influence in Albania, attacking Italian settlements and buisnesses in our country but now they come to us on peaceful terms to make an offer. The only threat Frashëri despises more than Italy is socialsim. He has offered the services of the Balli Kombetar militia to help defend Albania from anymore Socialist encroachment. While this will help not only bolster our armed forces but will also give us more legitimacy to the average Albanian. Despite the optimism from many in our government, some warn of the possible threat of allowing such a violent faction to gain power in our government."
alb.10.a:0 "We must become a unified front to counter the Socialist rebels."
alb.10.b:0 "Balli are just the other side of the same treasonous coin."

alb.14.t:0 "Remnants of the defeated Albanian NLM flee across our southern border"
alb.14.d:0 "For years the socialist Albanian National Liberation Movement has been fighting a guerrilla campaign to liberate Albania from Italian rule. Recently Italian and Albanian forces have routed the NLM from there base in the Korab mountains forcing the survivors into our borders.

alb.15.t:0 "Battle of Tirana"
alb.15.d:0 "The National Liberation Movement, emboldened by our governments failiures to crush them, have launched a full scale assault on our capital city Tirana.

alb.18.t:0 "Albania has fallen to Collectivism!"
alb.18.d:0 "Albania has been plagued by instability for years. The socialist National Liberation Movement has been in a guerrilla war with our ally in Tirana and despite our support of their regime they have fallen to NLM. With most of Albania under NLM control it is only a matter of time before our key port at Vlore is attacked and with it our access to the Adriatic.
