#SecularDebate

seculardebate.1.t:0 "The Government tackles the Secular Debate"
seculardebate.1.d:0 "With the election forthcoming, a major debate has arisen over the issue of secularization in El Salvador. While some, particularly those with corporate interests, wish to diminish the power of the Church, others hold it would be a contradiction of the nation's founding values. Furthermore, there is a belief that secular entities like the United Fruit Company would grow even stronger, too strong, as they fill the vacuum of power. We should seek to settle the debate as best we can in the coming months, or else the issue will call for radical solutions."
seculardebate.1.a:0 "The Debate begins..."
seculardebate.2.t:0 "The Secular Debate: Is the Church too powerful?"
seculardebate.2.d:0 "In the rural regions of our country, the Catholic Church wields immense power. Those who go against the promoted beliefs of their local priests rarely achieve even a modicum of power, and on a national level, the wealth and influence of the Church has been a deciding factor for numerous bills and policies. While this sway has diminished in recent years, few will take any action a priest forbids, even if it were in the benefit of the nation. Some ask, is this too much power? Can El Salvador be a proper, egalitarian republic with the clergy holding such sway? But, of course, there is really only one group that could push away the Church's influence successfully: the United Fruit Company."
seculardebate.2.a:0 "There must be a clear line between Church and State by any means!"
seculardebate.2.b:0 "We will always be a devout country, not a corporate puppet!"
seculardebate.3.t:0 "The Secular Debate: Is the Company too powerful?"
seculardebate.3.d:0 "Ever since the Americans reasserted themselves across the continent, the United Fruit Company has grown as ever powerful spectre across all of Central America. Then, as the US renewed a policy of so-called trustbusting, the Company focused its power in Central America. But blight in several countries and revolution in Guatemala has seen the Company focus itself here in El Salvador. They have made a stronghold to hide from the US Government's trustbusting via their child companies. The Tropical Radio and Telegraph Company controls our communications infrastructure, the Tropical Construction Service maintains our roads, White Fleet Munitions supplies our military, and the UF-Socony Joint Venture fuels our ships and electricity. All recent presidents have had to pay them lip-service and make backroom deals to ensure their own election. Needless to say, some wish to break this corporate hold. As we are lacking government autonomy from them, it seems it may be up to the Catholic Church to work to weaken UFCO's grasp."
seculardebate.3.a:0 "Their entrenchment means that when they benefit, we benefit."
seculardebate.3.b:0 "What would Jesus do? Whip the merchants and money-changers out!"
seculardebate.4.t:0 "The Secular Debate: An Empty Lot"
seculardebate.4.d:0 "In an almost quintessential showcase of the debate gripping the nation, a recent dispute has sparked protests in San Salvador. An empty lot is at the source. Years ago, this lot was once a local shop that was bought out and demolished by UFCO. The construction of a new clothing store was never fully approved, and the lot was lost in a sea of paperwork, left untouched. The locals of the neighborhood began to use it as a meeting place, and it became a place where local priests have held outdoor sermons, as the nearest church lacks the needed capacity. UFCO rediscovered the lot, and arrived to find the parishioners had placed hand-crafted pews and a pulpit. After corporate thugs cleared these faithful out, the situation has only gotten worse. Some feel the lot should be used how the community wishes, given its abandonment, but others argue that it was private property, and that the only reason the issue is up for debate is because the Church is now involved."
seculardebate.4.a:0 "Like it or not, it was owned land. The Church can't just occupy it."
seculardebate.4.b:0 "After so many years, the lot belongs to the community, not the company."
seculardebate.5.t:0 "The Secular Debate: A Day Off"
seculardebate.5.d:0 "Yet another scandal is rocking our small country. The Tropical Construction Service has always brought in both local and foreign labor for its projects. Recently, a large petition and threatening of strike by Christian workers allowed for the granting of Sundays off. In a move to recoup losses, the company encouraged Jewish employees to fill this day, with higher paying hours offered. However, these workers had their own demands, requesting that they be allowed Saturdays off for Sabbath. Encouraged by this, Muslim employees, a recent influx after UFCO created a recruiting outpost in Phoenicia, requested Friday afternoons off for the jumu'ah prayer, in exchange for being able to work both Saturdays and Sundays at normal pay. The company agreed to both demands once it was clear they would see no sizeable loss in funds, but a sizeable gain in employee morale. However, the Catholic Church is outraged at what it calls the "empowering of heathens" by the company, and has called a strike in protest. The company now seeks government intervention."
seculardebate.5.a:0 "Break up the strike. The company was only being fair."
seculardebate.5.b:0 "The Church is right. This is a dangerous pluralist precedent."
seculardebate.6.t:0 "The Secular Debate: United Fruit v. Acosta"
seculardebate.6.d:0 "A case has risen now to the highest courts. Emilio Justiniano Acosta Vergara, a former entrepreneur and salesman, has been called in on a number debts by the United Fruit Textile & Clothing Company, as well as the Tropical Radio and Telegraph Company, and even White Fleet Munitions. A few years ago, through a long, complicated series of events, Acosta created a numerous variety of ventures, taking money from various sources, with these UFCO child companies being the most prominent. The confidence man swindled them and attempted to use promises of large returns on initial investments in a variety of fraudulent ideas and businesses. Using money from other investors as proof of returns, he amassed and spent a sizeable portion of the money before cashing out. He went on the run, and supposedly found God on the way, joining a monastery as 'Brother Emilio'. \n\nSwearing off his lying and greedy ways, the aged man willingly came to court after he was discovered a few months ago. As an aesthetic monk, Acosta has nothing to his name but notoriety of the now infamous 'Acosta Scheme.' His investors, however, are demanding compensation, as they are still within the statue of limitations, if barely, and claim that Acosta's disappearance does not protect him. They also note that Acosta gave the rest of his money, enough to cover much of the companies' losses, to the monastery. They want that money back."
seculardebate.6.a:0 "The money was stolen, no matter where it went. Rule in favor of the corporations."
seculardebate.6.b:0 "He's a changed man, and the money is now the monastery's. Rule in favor of Acosta."
seculardebate.7.t:0 "The Secular Debate: An Impasse"
seculardebate.7.d:0 "Despite our efforts, the Secular Debate rages on, perhaps even worse than before as the spotlight was shined on several major events. Both sides have their points, and no one is certain which will truly dominate, particularly as many members of the National Democratic Party have claimed neutrality on the issue. It seems the matter will be settled by one thing and one thing only: the election."
seculardebate.7.a:0 "To the polls!"

#1937 Elections

ELS_election.1.t:0 "The Election of 1937: The Situation"
ELS_election.1.d:0 "Since the assumption of power by President Carlos Meléndez Ramirez was approved by both the United States and later the United Fruit Company, a political dynasty has ruled, passing from one approved heir to another, and as time went on, the wealthy landowning elite lost power to either the Church or the Company, with each presidency in the chain bowing to one or the other. However, President José Castellanos Contreras has been one of the best in that chain, listening to people's woes and attempting to balance corporate interests and populist sentiments without giving way to a breakdown of the state, shifting the corrupt National Democratic Party to work for bettering the people. But walking this fine line has taken a toll on the man, and his last attempt at reforming the nation by backing the liberal but well connected Fernando Ruiz as his successor has failed, when Ruiz committed 'suicide' via a shot to the back of the head. This has left the National Democratic Party scrambling to replace him, and this means there is now a window for other, more extreme parties. With their neutrality in the Secular Debate decried by most, the Democrats have poor odds..."
ELS_election.1.a:0 "May the best man win?"
ELS_election.2.t:0 "The Election of 1937: The Candidates"
ELS_election.2.d:0 "Without a clear heir, the National Democratic Party has partnered with the Prosperity Party, a near openly UFCO-backed political group. Replacing the dead Ruiz, they now have named the mysterious Rodolfo Duke as their candidate. The wealthy banker was once unknown, and few still know what he even looks like, but the party machine has been hard at work to put his name in everyone's heads, and the corporations are ensuring their workers vote properly. \n\nIn counter, the opposition has coalesced through aggressive annexations by the radically Christian and authoritarian Salvationist Front, which openly models itself after the Valkists in Germany. Their leader, former general and fringe occultist Maximiliano Hernández Martínez, has used the chaos before Duke's nomination to fervently promote himself, hijacking UFCO radio waves to give long rants and scalding criticisms of the government. His popularity grows each day, and his own personal men, so-called 'Crusader Volunteers', have begun intimidating all other opponents to Duke into supporting him."
ELS_election.2.a:0 "Shadowy bankers and religious zealots. Dios mio..."
ELS_election.3.t:0 "The Election of 1937: The Speeches"
ELS_election.3.d:0 "Only three months from the election, Duke and Hernández have begun giving speeches; or rather, in Duke's case, having others give his speeches. All of Duke's have begun by stating that, as he is busy outlining policy and legislation for the betterment of the nation, he has taken the time to write a speech, but unfortunately cannot give it himself as he works. Duke's rhetoric of prosperity of growth holds much the same message as most corporate lobbyists, but his ideas have begun to spark a thought: could El Salvador use the corporations in its benefit? In contrast, Hernández has taken to the waves himself, using fiery rhetoric that resonates with much of the rural countryside and invigorates the religious. He calls for El Salvador to take its place in the sun as a strong nation, to be a spiritual leader for the Americas on the path of God and Righteousness."
ELS_election.3.a:0 "Both have some strong points..."
ELS_election.4.t:0 "The Election of 1937: The Results"
ELS_election.4.d:0 "It was a tight race of extremes, with no punches pulled as the posters and criers of Duke met the marches and radio rants of Hernández. There is little middle ground, as the fervor has swept the nation, dividing families and communities as they choose their side. The Company, or the Church. The Party, or the Front. Wealth, or Faith. The events of the Secular Debate certainly weighed in on the election, and now we see what fate the nation has chosen. And the numbers have come in. The winner, and President is..."
ELS_election.4.a:0 "Rodolfo Duke! We're all gonna be rich!"
ELS_election.5.t:0 "The Election of 1937: The Results"
ELS_election.5.d:0 "It was a tight race of extremes, with no punches pulled as the posters and criers of Duke met the marches and radio rants of Hernández. There is little middle ground, as the fervor has swept the nation, dividing families and communities as they choose their side. The Company, or the Church. The Party, or the Front. Wealth, or Faith. The events of the Secular Debate certainly weighed in on the election, and now we see what fate the nation has chosen. And the numbers have come in. The winner, and President is..."
ELS_election.5.a:0 "Maximiliano Hernández Martínez! Praise the Lord!"
ELS_election.6.t:0 "The Forbidden Mansion"
ELS_election.6.d:0 "Apparently suffering from a rather nasty cough, Rodolfo Duke wrote his acceptance speech and had another read it in his place. To quell rumors that he did not exist, however, the new President did give a wave to a crowd outside of the Presidential Grand Mansion, a lavish home built by the second President Meléndez. Since then, new legislation has been presented, all written by Duke, and all obviously intended to increase the symbiosis of the United Fruit Company and the government of El Salvador. His messages and notices are frequent, with "Presidential Notifications" being posted in town squares every so often, but the man is rarely seen, even by his own staff and cabinet, who deal through intermediaries. Only UFCO representatives are regularly allowed to see him, the doors of the President's office closed and locked once they enter, but the nation can at least be assured that he is at work fulfilling his promises."
ELS_election.6.a:0 "If he's in there, we at least know he's getting things done!"
ELS_election.7.t:0 "The Lord Shall Reign"
ELS_election.7.d:0 "After his acceptance speech, President Hernández has made a shocking announcement: he will not be president. Instead, he will assume the new office of State Mandatary, which will hold almost all the same powers. But the official head of state, and ruler of the nation, will not be a mere man. Instead, it will be Jesus Christ, Our Lord and Saviour, King of Kings, and now President of Presidents."
ELS_election.7.a:0 "An entirely symbolic act, of course."
ELS_election.7.b:0 "...and He will reign forever and ever."
ELS_election.8.t:0 "Corporate Takeover"
ELS_election.8.d:0 "A month into the presidency of Rodolfo Duke, and many of his "advisors" have begun to question of the illusion of a republic is truly needed. The people sided with Duke, believe in his policies, and it is no secret he is creating a corporatist state. Some argue that the farce should be ended, the company outright declare control of the country. These people are usually given hard glares until the stop talking."
ELS_election.8.a:0 "Fools. The Vote proves to them how much they agree with us."
ELS_election.8.b:0 "But they're right! End the sham!"

#Crusaders & Mercenaris

ELS_crusaders.1.t:0 "Crusaders Initiative"
ELS_crusaders.1.d:0 "Our Crusader-Volunteers were instrumental in ensuring the victory of the party and the strength of our new, glorious state. Now that we have consolidated power more securely, leaders of the volunteer units have asked we expand their role and use them to bolster our military. With our dismantling of much of UFCO in our country, plenty of young, Christian men are out of work. They could serve us well as soldiers for our glorious cause!"
ELS_crusaders.1.a:0 "We must prepare for our expansion."
ELS_crusaders.2.t:0 "The Crusaders Are Ready!"
ELS_crusaders.2.d:0 "It has taken many months of advertising, recruiting, training, and indoctrination, but at last we have expanded the Crusader-Volunteers into a proper military force. The mandate set out before has at last been reached, and while more time to prepare battleplans and exercise drills is needed, El Salvador now has a military that cna defend her!"
ELS_crusaders.2.a:0 "Sharpen your blades and prepare the metaphorical trebuchets!"
ELS_crusaders.3.t:0 "Our Great Crusade"
ELS_crusaders.3.d:0 "We have prepared an extensive battle plan to strike at the heart of corruption that surrounds us. The regions of Honduras and Guatemala, crawling with socialist heretics and America's bootlickers. We must strike, liberate the pious peoples in this territory, and welcome them into our glorious and blessed nation. We're ready. It is time."
ELS_crusaders.3.a:0 "Deus Vult!"

ELS_PMC.1.t:0 "Private Security Proposal
ELS_PMC.1.d:0 "Now that control of El Salvador as a totally corporate state has been recognized and solidified, we can now begin to consider expanding the power of the company in geopolitical as well as economic means. To this end, members of the board have proposed the hiring and training of private security contractors — mercenaries — to aid in this endeavor. A number of people and groups are being interviewed."
ELS_PMC.1.a:0 "Hopefully they won't be too expensive..."
ELS_PMC.2.t:0 "PMC Contracts Signed"
ELS_PMC.2.d:0 "After a lengthy process of interviews, testing, and demonstrations against local insurgents, we have at last signed the contracts for the formation of army of private security companies. Now we just need some time to train them for our battleplans."
ELS_PMC.2.a:0 "Welcome to the UFCO family, gentlemen!"
ELS_PMC.3.t:0 "National Asset Seizures"
ELS_PMC.3.d:0 "Everything is set. The money has been transfered, our troops know the strategy by heart, and we've made contact with cooperative individuals in both Guatemala and Honduras. Our vast plantations and factories that have been seized by the socialist government will again be ours."
ELS_PMC.3.a:0 "It's just good business."
