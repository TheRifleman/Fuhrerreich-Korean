#### EVENTS ####
sweden.0.t:0 "The Status of Sweden"
sweden.0.d:0 "Neutrality with reservations, is how western Europe looked upon the Kingdom of Sweden. \n\nSweden, and it's king, Gustav the Fifth had a clear favouritism to his Germanic brethren,  yet remained committed to neutrality, even when Denmark broke theirs.\n\nIt was decision not made out of loyalty and commitment, but out of inability, hunger and weakness. The North Sea blockade starved Sweden into rationing and austerity, pushing it into an economic slump. \n\nThe consequences were worse than anyone had imagined, and the conservative government did little to solve the problems. The German loyalists among them refused to barter or negotiate with the west, and soon they paid a steep price for it. In 1917, inspired by the February revolution, the Swedish proletariat rose up in "The Hunger Revolution", demanding more rights, more liberty, and most of all more food. \n\nThe military struck them down, cutting deep wounds between the left and the right wings of politics. No compromise could be forged, both were jaded by the others insolence. When the war ended and the Kaiserreich was broken, Sweden's monarchists looked at it with sorrow. Never shall that fate strike us, they swore. The battles for suffrage and parliamentarism within politics now ground to a halt, more individuals looked towards King and Fatherland than towards market economics or social welfare. A rift was torn open, and it remains even as the mid 30s roll by. An uncompromising left, a desperate conservatism, and a new reactionary pledge to autocracy all battle for supremacy in the Riksdag. \nThe election of 1936 could see any one of them triumph, it could see welfare, market liberalism, or even a return to true monarchism take the reigns of government. \n\nRegardless of what happens, Sweden no longer wishes to be the little neutral nation in the north. It seeks to be a Lion once more, and to let Europe hear it's roar."
sweden.0.a:0 "Change is coming..."

The spooke of that the 'Establishment' has brought the economic crisis upon Sweden. He claimed that to get over this, the people of Sweden needed to vote on someone that will set the people, nation, and the military and industrial might first. Engdahl's movement, Nysvenska Rörelsen, has been working with the SNF/KFp Coalition, and the three party has formed a triplealliance in the Parliament, making them a powerful opposition."
sweden.8.a:0 "So he believe he can fix this?"
sweden.9.t:0 "Sven Linderot's Demand to the Voters"
sweden.9.d:0 "The day after Per Engdahl's speech, the far-left politican, Sven Linderot, held a speech in the industrial center of Stockholm. There he encouraged the people to not listen on what far-right politicans was saying, by claiming: "The far-right is in kahoot with the oppressive corperations. We shall give the power back to the people.". The establishment has been worried of far-left activities, with many conservatives choosing to align for a more nationalist and authoritarian path. What Linderot said could make moderate conservatives more willing to enter coalition with more right-winged radical parties."

sweden.10.t:0 "The 1936 Swedish general election"
sweden.10.d:0 "With the London Crash still fresh in people's mind, they have gone to vote. Many experts says that this might be Sweden's most important election in it's history, with individuals and groups both on the left and the right nearly fighting for power. There are three possible outcomes: \n\nA leftwing coaltion between socialists and social democrats, with the social democratic party, Sveriges Socialdemokratiska Parti, as the leaders of the coalition. They are also able to get support from the far-left and centre, and may get extra support from individuals that have left the conservatives. \n\nA centre-right coalition between the liberals and conservatives, with the conservative party, Allmänna Valmansförbundet, as leaders of the coalition. There are a chance for them to get support from agrarians and nationalists. But the conservatives are playing a uphill battle, with many leaving them as the day goes. \n\nThe last option that is on the table is the far-right coalition gaining power. The ideologies of Swedish nationalism and newswedishness has struck into the heart of many swedes. Many feels that those ruling Sweden today tries to contain the country's power. While the far-right parties are united, they are divided on who shall lead them, and they can only come to power with help from other parties in the parliament. Some believes that the conservatives will support this to hinder a social democratic victory."

KFp gained too little support to be the main party, but SNF and Nya Sverige did get the support for either of them to establish government on the Far-Right."

sweden.420.d:0 "In 1814, directly following the wake of the Napoleonic wars, Sweden gained control of the kingdom of Norway and the two entered a personal union which would last until 1905. Sweden-Norway remained neutral in nearly all conflicts of the later 19th centuary but durring this time it cemented itself as one of the richest nations in Europe with one of the continents highest standard of living. This blissful isolation has been chalenged several times though. Sweden-Norway refused to support Denmark in their war against Prussia in 1864 which would permanently damaged support for a united Scandinavia. After nearly a century together Sweden and Norway disolved the union in 1905 on good terms. \n\nRelations between the nordic nations have remained good until the socialist party "Arbeiderpartiet" took power in Norway and ousted the Royal Family in a controversial referendum. Coming out of the ashes of the failed revolution in Sweden, Swedish conservatives rallied together against this new ideological enemy. For the last decade tensions in northern Europe have been high and in the wake of the London Stock Crash have finally reached a boiling point. The war between out nations was brutal but the Swedes have come out victorious over the revolutionaries and for the first time since 1905 our nations are one. In this ever changing world we must be strong to survive. A united Scadinavia will be too powerful for any nation to overcome! Shall we reform the union between our glorious states?"

swenews.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]During the Great War, Norway found themselves in a precarious position to say the least. The War ended up opening a rift between the classes of Norway, notably the Upper-class and Lower-class. Many resorted to the teachings of Karl Marx, and following a major Strike gone violent in Olso, the Arbeiderpartiet (Labour Party) pulled a large majority in the following elections. A referendum on the abolishment of the monarchy was soon held, and a 52.1% saw it through… Much to the dissatisfaction of their neighbors. \n\nJust recently after the Victory of the Nationalist/Loyalist Coalition in Sweden; it has become apparent that Sweden has looked to break their policy of neutrality. Campaigning against Socialism in Scandinavia, Gustaf V is eager to demonstrate that Sweden is willing to meet Socialists with force."

SWE_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Sweden was once one of Europe's greatest power. Today, they are only a regional power in Scandinavia. After the Napoleonic wars, the kingdom has gone the path of neutrality even when Europe burned under the Great War. Even when the North Sea blockade crippled the economy and the Swedish peoples ability to bring food home, that led to the "Hunger Revolution". \n\nAfter the war, Swedish politics where marked by strife between the right and the left, and a growth in far-right parties. It is yet to see where Sweden will go."
POLITICS_GUSTAF_V_DESC:0 "King Gustaf V of Sweden has been the king of Sweden since 1907. He is the eldest son of the late king Oscar II and Sophia of Nassau. Gustaf grew up in the 19th century of the autocratic kingdom of Sweden, but when he ascended the throne, Sweden was already transforming into a parliamentarian democracy. In 1881, Gustaf married Victoria of Baden, a german noble woman and a descendance of a former royal house of Sweden. Under the great war the king, and escpesially his wife, was leaning on the pro-german side, but Sweden continued its neutrality. Today, king Gustaf is an old man. He is a king from an another century and it will to see how the future will bring to the Swedish royal house."
