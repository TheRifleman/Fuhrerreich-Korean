ukempire.16a.d:0 "As the revolt in East Africa continues for the moment, the South African Government has reached out to Westminster with offers of military aid in combatting the dangerous insurgency in our colonies."
ukempire.16b.d:0 "As the revolt in East Africa continues for the moment, the South African Government has reached out to Westminster with open political support for our efforts in quelling unrest in our colonies."
ukempire.17.d:0 "As the threat of war continues to rise unabated around the globe, our friends in Canada have requested further assistance in bolstering their naval position in the Pacific and North Atlantic in the form of additional naval vessels. While such a request is typically turned down by our Government - as it is the job of the Royal Navy to safe-guard the Empire - these changing times seem to indicate that we need a fresh approach to naval affairs."
ukempire.18.d:0 "With our country currently besieged by violent revolutionaries and radicals, there is a great deal of anxiety growing not only in our own country and government, but also in our Dominions overseas.\n\nThis morning rumours began to spread of a note being delivered to the King from the Canadian PM. Although it is currently unknown what exactly was said in the letter, the fact that is was sent to the King rather to our own Government has raised more than a few eyebrows."
ukempire.19.d:0 "The effects of the LSMC continue to be felt worldwide and across the Empire as the years trundle on, with varying degrees of success being achieved in dealing with the crisis itself across our territories. Finding it particularly difficult to remedy this catastrophe, the Australian Government has today requested economic aid be sent to their country in an effort to stem the decline effecting their nation."
ukempire.20.d:0 "With our inability to properly commit to delivering the autonomy to the Dominion nations as was promised in the Imperial Conference of '37, the Dominion states of the Empire have made a concerted political push-back against our nation in an attempt to force us to acquiesce to their demands.\n\nDelaying the implementation of further autonomy will only result in these effects becoming worse over time."
ukempire.21.d:0 "Since achieving the position of First Lord of the Admiralty once more, Leo Amery has pursued many reforms within the Royal Navy to assist in the development and modernisation of its force. Up until this morning there were however rumours circulating about Amery abusing his position in Government to back the Round Table Movement - a political movement which pushes for the creation of an Imperial Federation of the Empire -, this morning these reports were validated as pictures emerged of him attending one of these Round Table Movement meetings in Leicester alongside some influential thinkers across the Empire.\n\nThose within our Government who already held reservations about Amery and his position have naturally called for his resignation, though such an act seems unnecessary. Rather the the Prime Minister believes there are two options available to the Government in response to this, we may either request Amery stop these meetings and threaten his removal of office if he persists, or we can support his efforts to create a larger political influence for the Round Table Movement.\n\nThough established originally in Britain in 1909, the RTM has since spread across the Empire, with many influential politicians being a part of the Movement. If we give backing to Amery it is likely he will push for the creation of several more lodges overseas and across the Empire, the results of which are likely to draw further support for the Imperial Federation across the Empire."

empire.1.d:0 "Yesterday afternoon - following intense discussion during this year's Imperial Conference - the British Government issued a formal proclamation stating that they wish to pursue renewed Imperialism across the globe.\n\nMet with less-than-concealed hesitation and anxiety by many of the Dominions, Westminster seems relatively unconcerned over our protestations to the matter. Some within our Government believe that by sending them a formal note of protest we may at least put some degree of diplomatic pressure on Britain to backtrack somewhat on these statements."
empire.2.d:0 "Late last night, in a move that shocked many across the Empire, Westminster announced the deployment of British troops to the streets of Ireland in an effort to crush remaining IRB cells throughout the Irish Isles. In many ways mirroring the scenes from the Easter Rising, the sight of British troops on Irish streets was met with shock and anger by many Irish citizens of the Empire, including without our own nation. Our Government believes it will be necessary to issue a note of concern to Britain in an effort to limit the political fallout within our own nation and to distance ourselves from their actions."
empire.3a.d:0 "Following several weeks of unrest across the British Isles culminating in wide-scale rioting across the capital the British Government officially stepped down, paving the way for the King to officially dissolve Parliament and take control over Britain.\n\nTaking many by surprise, the King has moved swiftly to quell the remaining unrest across the United Kingdom by imposing harsh curfews and maintaining Martial Law in several cities indefinitely.\n\nWhile many are breathing a sigh of relief across the Empire, many more are worried that today marks the beginning of a wave of authoritarianism that will sweep across the Empire, ostensibly to protect the people of the Empire, but in reality used as an excuse by King Edward VIII to impose his view of the Empire.\n\nWhat should our reaction to these events in Britain be?"
empire.3b.d:0 "Following several weeks of unrest across the British Isles culminating in wide-scale rioting across the capital the British Government failed to end the crisis gripping the United Kingdom, rather it would be left to the British Armed Forces to do so, with the British Army spear-heading the charge by storming the Houses of Parliament.\n\nWhile the King has since remained quiet outside of his criticism of those political figures siding with the rioters, it is believed he is in quiet support for the Armed Forces in their endeavour to restore order to Britain. Worryingly is the recent efforts by the Armed Forces to 'restore order' with reports on brutal crackdowns throughout the country and vicious attacks on anyone deemed to be socialist. Our Government has been quietly expressing reservations over the new Government in Britain, though in the coming days we must make our stance on the matter public."
empire.4.d:0 "In recent weeks, a formerly political fringe group has been gaining traction within our nation; the Round Table Movement.\n\nAdvocating for an Imperial Federation of the Empire, the group has set up several lodges within our country to attract influential politicians and thinkers to its ranks. So far its effects have been negligible and, surprisingly, positive. As many of its members are firm supporters for the Government of our nation and the Empire itself."

safempire.1.d:0 "As British East Africa descends into anarchy, spurred on by violent unrest at the instruction of independence movements many within our own Government are questioning what our position should be on this issue. Supporting Britain, whether it be militarily or politically will no doubt curry favour in London, but not involving ourselves in the affair will strengthen our political position at home."
safempire.2.d:0 "With the revolt in East Africa finally put to rest by British - and our own - forces, our advisory elements have returned home bringing with them the experience learned fighting in rough terrain against insurgent elements. This will no doubt help the development of our army."

canempire.2a.d:0 "At the request of our Government, Britain has instructed the Royal Navy to send us several vessels to help bolster our Navy in the North Atlantic and Pacific."
canempire.2b.d:0 "Despite our request for assistance, Westminster has opted to refuse our call for aid and has instead instructed us to improve port facilities for the Royal Navy in the region."
canempire.3.d:0 "As news of developments in Britain continue to trickle out to the world, a sense of anxiety is growing in our own country as to fate of the Government in London.\n\nAssailed by radicals and revolutionaries, it seems more likely by the day that the Government will be brought down by violent protest, if this were to happen it would fall to our nation as the senior member of the Empire in taking over the administrative duties and leadership of our far-flung territories.\n\nSome of those in our Government however are hoping that the King will step in and order the Government in Westminster to step down via his royal prerogative. Such an act would no doubt prove destabilising, but if the choice is between that or revolution, is there really much choice at all?"

ausempire.1.d:0 "With the effects of the London Stock Market Crash continuing to severely impact our nation, many possible options for dealing with the crisis have been raised in Parliament. In the past few weeks, several influential politicians within our Government have begun calling on the Prime Minister to request economic assistance from Britain as a means of alleviating the worst of the crisis. Such a request would be considered normal in times such as this, but due to the severity of the crisis it is unknown what the response from London will be."
ausempire.2a.d:0 "This morning the British Government informed us that they would agree to send us economic aid to assist in curtailing the effects of the London Stock Market Crash. This supply of economic assistance will continue for a period of one year."
ausempire.2b.d:0 "This morning the British Government officially replied to our request for economic aid, stating that they could not send us economic assistance that do they not have to give, citing the severe economic situation in Britain as the reason for withholding any assistance."
