CHL_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "For a nation that didn't fight in the Great War, the years showed that what happened during it greatly affected Chile. The rise of new processes that allow the synthesis of fertilizers demolished the core of its economy, as the long-coming social issues were kept unanswered and chance of reform was blocked by the unfriendly and unefficient parlamentary system, the people of Chile have began losing faith in the system, and the country is only but a shade of what it was 20 years ago."

chl.1.t:0 "A Nation on its Knees"
chl.1.d:0 "Before the Great War, our nation was strong and on the rise, no one could talk of South America before mentioning Chile as one of its powers, and we were on the path to greatness, or so we thought. The weak parlamentary system that has been rulling us has made us susceptible to change and slow to reform, and has hushed the voice of the people. \nBut during the Great War, Saltpetre, the lifeblood of our economy, stopped being a sought after resource. Now our economy is on the floor and the faults on our government are more visible than ever. Our people have almost lost faith in democracy and are seeking a leader that can bring the changes to lift up our fallen nation to its glorious fate again, we must be careful cause extreme movements are on the rise and the people will seek any way to have its voice heard, be it by reason, or by force. Meanwhile, figures and political actors scheme how to reach power. What path will Chile take?"
chl.1.a:0 "We must stand united at our lowest point."
chl.2.t:0 "A Critical Point"
chl.2.d:0 "While the government has done what it can with the few power it has to amend our economy during this crisis, the Chilean people has still been greatly affected by its circumstances and it still is, as political polarization increased, no one was surprised as people recurred to extremist groups to reclaim their hopes and dreams of a a better future.\n The March on Santiago occurred, as thousands of disconent chileans, united under the banner of the Valquistas, promising a national rebirth, and a government that truly represents the spirit of the nation; and the leadership of Jorge "El Jefe" González Von Marées, stood together and marched their way into La Moneda, as the government was backed into a corner, with no place left to run."
chl.2.a:0 "Prepared for the crisis, the Army quickly intervened and stopped the Marching Valkists."
chl.2.b:0 "The March on Santiago Succeeds, as Chile walks under Valquismo's banner."
chl.2.c:0 "The nation will take control of its own destiny, off the world's claws!"
chl.3.t:0 "Elections of 1940"
chl.3.d:0 "So little ago it seemed like democracy had collapsed and our country was on the verge of ruin, now however, democracy has been proven to the right system for our people and a tradition in our nation, and our country has found its long lost stability. Time has come for democracy to pick our new leader, as Montero's term has come to an end. Who will the people's will decide for? What ideology will guide our people in this dangerous world?"
chl.3.a:0 "Eduardo Cruz-Coke, PC's candidate, Conservative yet reformist."
chl.3.b:0 "Gustavo Ross, PL's candidate, prominent economist and free-market advocate"
chl.3.c:0 "Marmaduque Grove, PS's candidate, former military man & democratic socialist."
chl.3.e:0 "Juan Antonio Rios, PR's candidate, reformist and favourite to succeed Montero."
chl.4.t:0 "The military stops the Valquistas"
chl.4.d:0 "As the Army steps in and succesfully fights off the Valquistas, driving the extremists away from power, different military factions realize the situation they are in. The Army can now decide what path will Chile take, while many are content with being the protectors of the Republic, a sizeable group amongst the high command, lead by General Carlos Ibañez del Campo, feel that maybe Chile needs a stronger guiding hand, to get through its current chaos, seeing the multiple failures of the past governments, it is hard to argue it could go worse."
chl.4.a:0 "The republic's government is for us to defend, as is its democracy."
chl.4.b:0 "A stronger leadership may be able to finally solve our problems."
chl.10.t:0 "Communist Demonstrations"
chl.10.d:0 "As our hold on the political base of our nation grows, extremists are unhappy at our success. Some far left groups, of the likes of the Communist Party have began demonstrations on the streets, cutting off traffic and interrupting a planned speech by our General. This kind of defiance against authority can't be allowed, specially when it interrupts the natural order of our country."
chl.10.a:0 "Strenghten security in the streets and continue with Ibañez's political effort."
chl.10.b:0 "The extremists are too dangerous, let's just spread propaganda against them."
chl.13.t:0 "Carlos Ibañez is assassinated!"
chl.13.d:0 "The speech went as intended, our people were content, everyone was cheering, feeling happy protected under the General's wing, or so they thought they were. But as the event was coming to an end, the extreme left groups began demonstrating in the street around the corner, knowing the danger he was in, the general prepared himself to leave, however, one of the insurgents got close and was able to shoot Ibañez in the head. The insurgent was shot on the spot, but a tragedy has ocurred. Our general is dead. The military high command has taken control of the nation in this hour of sorrow."
chl.13.a:0 "Gral. Blanche promises to bring democracy back to the republic."
chl.13.b:0 "Gral. Blanche establishes martial law and the military regime continues."
chl.14.t:0 "The Social Question."
chl.14.d:0 "As the nation anticipates the next elections and the return of democracy, General Blanche has done what he can to protect our nation from falling into disarray, specially with the rise of rebellious forces unhappy with the military's regime. Now, a question is in everyone's minds; What will be of Marmaduque Grove and the socialist party?. Grove, while a loud critic of the dictatorship, has spoken out and said he doesn't support the radical groups responsible for the death of General Ibañez. Nonetheless, distrust to his party has increased during these troubled times."
chl.14.a:0 "Grove's Socialists are exactly the kind of left we need, instead of those extremists."
chl.14.b:0 "The growth of the left only has hurt us, and the wound is still open, let's better ban the socialists from participating."
chl.15.t:0 "Returning to democracy."
chl.15.d:0 "We have gone through so much in so little time. Democracy was on the verge of failing, our economy was dead and buried. But look at us now, we have survived dangerous extremists as well as unestable dictatorships, at least until General Blanche came. And now democracy is ready to come back home, maybe things will finally turn out for the better, but the question is; Who will the people's will decide for? What ideology will guide our people in this dangerous world?"
chl.15.a:0 "Eduardo Cruz-Coke, PC's candidate, Conservative yet reformist."
chl.15.b:0 "Gustavo Ross, PL's candidate, prominent economist and free-market advocate"
chl.15.c:0 "Marmaduque Grove, PS's candidate, former military man & democratic socialist."

chl.17.t:0 "An offer from Chile"
chl.17.d:0 "Our nations have not had the best moments together, and wounds are slow to heal, however, the Chilean regime is of similar mind to us, and believes a mutually benefitial pact could be made. While our own national interests stand first, we are not without enemies, and such friendship may indeed be the best decision for our nation."
chl.17.a:0 "We agree to this pact."
chl.17.b:0 "Peru doesn't need friends."
chl.18.t:0 "Peru agrees into the pact!"
chl.18.d:0 "The diplomats have arrived with news. Peru has agreed into forming a pact with our nation, they too, see that this is better for both of us, to form such ties."
chl.18.a:0 "They are smart, it seems."
chl.19.d:0 "An offer has arrived from Chile. We may not have a lot of ties, friendly or otherwise, but the Chilean regime is of similar mind to us, and believes a mutually benefitial pact could be made. While our own national interests stand first, we are not without enemies, and such friendship may indeed be the best decision for our nation."
chl.19.a:0 "We agree to this pact."

chl.20.a:0 "They are smart, it seems."
chl.21.t:0 "Chile Invites Us"
chl.21.d:0 "Our nations have not had the best moments together, the wars still in our memory, but now more than ever South America is on the edge of blowing into conflict, and the Chilean government believes a defensive alliance could help for our countries during these difficult times, and is inviting us to stand together."
chl.21.a:0 "Democracies must stand together."
chl.21.b:0 "This may not be the best move."
chl.22.t:0 "Peru agrees into our alliance!"
chl.22.d:0 "The diplomats have arrived with news. Peru has agreed into forming a defensive alliance with our nation. Now more than ever, democracies are united during this time of upcoming conflict."
chl.22.a:0 "Today, we stand together."
chl.23.t:0 "Chile Invites Us"
chl.23.d:0 "Our diplomats are informing us of a pressing matter. As the diplomatic tension in the region escalates, the Chilean government believes a defensive alliance could help for our countries during these difficult times, and is inviting us to stand together."
chl.23.a:0 "Democracies must stand together."
chl.23.b:0 "This may not be the best move."
chl.24.t:0 "Ecuador agrees into our alliance!"
chl.24.d:0 "The diplomats have arrived with news. Ecuador has agreed into forming a defensive alliance with our nation. Now more than ever, democracies are united during this time of upcoming conflict."
chl.24.a:0 "Today, we stand together."

chl.1000.t:0 "Crowd Reunites in Valkist Gathering"
chl.1000.d:0 "As popular discontent continues accruing in our nation, the size of valkist gathering all around the country grows. Fueled by a strong contempt against democracy, and a dangerous rhetoric that mixes exaltation of Chile's past glory with a progressive, futurist mindset, the group has gained traction in the last few years, specially as valkism solidifies its hold in Germany.\nTheir largest gathering yet as occurred as González Von Marées gave a strong speech against democracy. "The elected leaders don't belong here, not one of them can understand nor share the political spirit of our united nation, they belong to a era far begone, as their republican system does. Throwing off their system Chile can let its voice be heard.", as the crowds cheered for "El jefe", as they call González."
chl.1000.a:0 "Maybe the republic has failed."
chl.1000.b:0 "Better censure his speech in the newspapers."
chl.1001.t:0 "Pro-Military Sentiment Growing"
chl.1001.d:0 "Tension increases in our nation as a small newspapers published supposed conversations between army officers discussing taking over if the current regime fails to improve the situation, quickly spreading between different media. \nWhile the military protected our rule in times of unstability, many suspect the high command has lost faith in our government, this idea, while new, has caused a lot of citizens to express their support for the military, going as far as asking them to liberate our country. No officer has commented on the matter."
chl.1001.a:0 "Maybe a stronger force ruling is what this country needs."
chl.1001.b:0 "The Army disobeying the government? Ridiculous!"
chl.1002.t:0 "Manuel Rojas challenges Valkism"
chl.1002.d:0 "Known poet, writer, and political figure Manuel Rojas has recently published a work in which he critizes Valkism and all that it stands for. Qualifying it as "vague, populistic, and tricking the people into not realizing the true social issues", he has caused many differing reactions amongst the population. \nManuel himself has been critical of our government as well, even if not denouncing democracy as the valkists have. That combined with his participation in the more extreme stands of the Socialist Party, makes him a figure to be careful about, many worrying he might be hiding intentions as extreme as the valkists themselves."
chl.1002.a:0 "Not everyone is fooled so easily by Valkism."
chl.1002.b:0 "We prefer revolutionaries that think of Chile first and foremost."
chl.1003.t:0 "Economical & Financial Readjustment bill passed"
chl.1003.d:0 "President Montero's new readjustment bill has been passed by the parliament, in a rare occasion of the representatives not delaying it too much. The Bill establishes some benefits to free investment and forgives some of the debts of the poorer. A welcome attempt to bring our economy back on foot, it still has been widely critizised for being too slight and not doing more for our economy. \n\n As the representatives were leaving the congress building, Jorge Silva Somarriva, Liberal Party deputy, and defender of the bill, was harrassed by a group of men on brown shirts, who accused him of not caring for the social issues and poisoning the nation. As the building's guards came for his help, he resulted mostly unharmed, but the men escaped. The polarization and violence in our society is reaching a critical point."
chl.1003.a:0 "We must be prudent while handling the economy, there is no justification to violence."
chl.1003.b:0 "Politicians that hide from the problems will be held accountable for, the people is unhappy."
chl.1004.t:0 "Debate ensues on Chamber of Deputies as Solidary Labour Law is passed"
chl.1004.d:0 "Earlier, the executive's Solidary Labour Law passed, protecting employees from abuse in overtime working and from nefarious contracts that may be considered abusive. While celebrated by many, some of the Socialist Party's representatives were disappointed by the little extent of the law, this devolved into a heated argument between Conservative Party's senator Hector Rodriguez de la Sotta and Socialist Party's senator Oscar Schnake, as the later accused the former of deliberatingly blocking any attempt to pass more extensive reforms. Finally the argument settled down as neither of the representatives talked to the other for the rest of the day, but the air was kept tense in the congress."
chl.1004.a:0 "So many arguments and conflicts between politicians, what is left for the people?"
chl.1005.t:0 "Workers go on strike and march"
chl.1005.d:0 "An unannounced development, workers went on strike and began marching today in Ñuñoa, as the streets were filled by the discontented workers, the air of this movement was different from previous manifestations. No support for the major left-wing parties was seen, for instance, although some men dressed in brown shirts were amongst the demonstration leading figures. Although discourse against the republic's political system and of treason by the ruling party against the chilean people was seen, luckily the manifestations finished without devolving into violence."
chl.1005.a:0 "Chile knows what it wants, it seems."
chl.1005.b:0 "Change doesnt come fast, but the republic is the only one that can bring it."
chl.1006.t:0 "President meets with Commander-in-Chief of the Army"
chl.1006.d:0 "Earlier today, President Montero reunited with Commander-in-Chief of the Army Luis Altamirano in La Moneda. This meeting was apparently spontaneously arranged, as it wasnt on the president's schedule, but lasted for a few hours and we only can assume topics concerning national security were discussed, as after the meeting, Montero decided to clear his schedule for the rest of the day. Let us hope this isn't a concern."
chl.1006.a:0 "This country needs some stability, maybe the Army could help."
chl.1006.b:0 "I am sure this is nothing."
chl.2000.t:0 "The Invasion of the Pacific"
chl.2000.d:0 "The newspapers and the radio have told everyone, our nation is on the cusp of a new age, the spirits are high even if doubts are in the air, as our nation's leader announced this morning that peace will plague us no more, and Chile will take what is rightfully ours. \nThe Pacific Islands controlled by the British Empire will be seized, no outcome can be accepted but victory and Chile's control of the South Pacific. We are going to war."
chl.2000.a:0 "By right or by might!"
chl.1999.t:0 "Chile Announces its intentions in the Pacific"
chl.1999.d:0 "News have arrived, and we've been informed that Chile is about to initiate an agressive expansion in islands in the South Pacific Ocean that are currently in British control. While we don't expect a lot from the south american nation's aggresive, populist government, maybe this event would be of use to us. Indeed, the Empire's all encroaching influence in the Pacific Ocean is a direct threat to our own interests, and we can't endanger Chile falling under British influence, voicing our support and defense of Chile's ambitions may be the best option."
chl.1999.a:0 "We stand in support of Chile's rightful claims and won't tolerate British imperialism."
chl.1999.b:0 "Conflicts between other nations aren't of importance to America."
chl.2001.t:0 "Chile invading our Domains"
chl.2001.d:0 "An additional threat is facing our empire as Chile is proclaiming an invasion of our South Pacific island domains. While we aren't in the best position to put our efforts into it right now, it shouldnt be a great problem for the Royal Navy to deal with. There is a greater consideration though, the United States, in a bid to antagonize us, have voiced their explicit support of Chile's ambitions, and if we intervene they may use this conflict as a way of creating conflict between us for control of the Pacific sphere of influence. \nAny confrontation with the States should be avoided at all cost, our loyal subject nations, however, may be able to handle this conflict without creating great political turmoil as to endanger our empire, they may even earn something out of all this."
chl.2001.a:0 "We won't relinquish our domain to empty threats, to arms!"
chl.2001.b:0 "Australia should have no trouble handling the matter by themselves."
chl.2006.t:0 "The Empire ignores our support of Chile"
chl.2006.d:0 "Surprise has taken ahold of the government as unexpectedly the British Empire hasn't backed off and has directly declared war upon Chile. While Chile may not provide much trouble for them, the empire has reached a weak point, and now more than ever may be our opportunity to strike against them and assert our influence as a great power to the world."
chl.2006.a:0 "They sought this!"
chl.2006.b:0 "Don't misunderstand us, we were never really challenging the Empire."
chl.2005.t:0 "Chile invading our Domains"
chl.2005.d:0 "An additional threat is facing our empire as Chile is proclaiming an invasion of our South Pacific island domains. While we aren't in the best position to put our efforts into it right now, it shouldnt be a great problem for the Royal Navy to deal with. Still, there are many considerations to be made while allocating our resources, and a safe option that wouldn't cost us that much is to make Australia handle the conflict, given its proximity and influence in the area, this may be a natural choice if we don't feel like intervining directly."
chl.2005.a:0 "We won't relinquish our domains to weak jingoistic states, to arms!"
chl.2005.b:0 "Australia should have no trouble handling the matter by themselves."
chl.2002.t:0 "War for the South Pacific"
chl.2002.d:0 "Harsh news arrive as the empire is attacked by a different threat, one closer to home. Chile is about to invade and try to seize the empire's south-east pacific island domains. They have mistaken our difficult situation for weakness, and it has fallen upon Australia's shoulders the weight of the matter. We will give our all to defend the ocean from these invaders!"
chl.2002.a:0 "To war!"
chl.2003.t:0 "Australia surrenders!"
chl.2003.d:0 "Crowds cheer at home as our soldiers occupy australian land. The Australian Government has sued for peace as their nation can't fight anymore and the islands are in our control, victory is finally at hand."
chl.2003.a:0 "We have reclaimed what was meant for us."
chl.2003.b:0 "This isn't time to stop, all of Australia must fall under our control!"
chl.2004.t:0 "Chile surrenders!"
chl.2004.d:0 "Crowds cheer at home as our soldiers occupy chilean land. The Chilean Government has sued for peace as their nation can't fight anymore and our domains are safe in our control, victory is finally at hand."
chl.2004.a:0 "Australia triumphs!"
chl.2004.b:0 "This isn't time to stop, all of Chile has to fall under our control!"
chl.2010.t:0 "Perú sues for peace"
chl.2010.d:0 "White flags are waved in the battlefront as the peruvians surrender, offering us what we once took from them, Tacna. South American success has finally returned to our nation in the same way we achieved it decades ago. We have won."
chl.2010.a:0 "Accept their surrender and retake Tacna."
chl.2010.b:0 "Only total victory is acceptable."
chl.2011.t:0 "Chileans Surrender"
chl.2011.d:0 "White flags are waved in the battlefront as the chileans surrender. Their reckless expanionism has finally come to bite them, as Perú will bring retribution to them and fix the past's mistakes."
chl.2011.a:0 "Retake our southern province, Arica"
chl.2011.b:0 "Don't stop until we control all of Chile."
chl.2012.t:0 "Bolivian government falls"
chl.2012.d:0 "The radical government of Bolivia has fallen as out troops march further into the country, while there are still some battles fought, it seems clear we are victors. Will we put a friendlier government on charge, or will we continue our expansion?"
chl.2012.a:0 "For a safer South America. (puppet Bolivia)"
chl.2012.b:0 "No stopping until the jungle is under chilean control."
