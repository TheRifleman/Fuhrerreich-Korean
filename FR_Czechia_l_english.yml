CZE_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "Czechoslovakia is no more. The survivor of a failed experiment, of crumbling chaos, and of violent revolution, the Czech have gone through much, and lost their dreams while trying their best to survive. Now, even democracy has been lost as the Czech dream of the return of stability and inner peace for their people.\nSome, however, have even greater dreams. Whether they are of national reunification, of irredentism, of revolution, or of liberation, many radical groups are still found inside Czechia, and only wise decisions by the military government might be able to secure a stable future for Czechia, as the chaos never seems to end."

cze.1.t:0 "The Status of Czechia"
cze.1.d:0 "The living corpse of the Czechoslovak dream, Czechia stands as a survivor in Europe. But after all, Czechoslovakia is dead for a reason. Czech-dominated centralization was its poison, and the Revolution of '31 was the killing blow.\n\nComing as the result of increased political polarization with the rise of the Collectivists, and triggering the different dissident movements in Czechoslovakia to wake up, the traitorous Slovaks, supported by perfidious Albion, left us in our lowest moment, when they should have stood with us against the socialist menace.\n\nAs the country sunk into chaos, and the government collapsed, the brave forces of the army's high command, lead by General Josef Šnejdárek, couped the state, establishing a military government to protect what was left of Czechoslovakia and stop the revolution. With support from our friends the French, the revolution came to an end. But Czechoslovakia was unsalvageable, the Treaty of Brno, where we were forced to recognize Slovak independence.\n\nThat was years ago, and now we enter 1936 with a clear objective. To bring Czechia to a new age, to leave the past behind, and solve the issues that have held our nation back. And maybe, the Czechs will rise again, and find a new dream. But the country is still very divided and affected, and the military government has grown unpopular, with many dreaming of a return to democracy. The future is uncertain, but we will try our best, that is certain and truth."
cze.1.a:0 "Pravda vítězí."
cze.40.t:0 "Karel Čapek - War with the Molemen"
cze.40.d:0 "Prominent science fiction writer Karel Čapek has published his last work, titled "War with the Molemen".\n\nThe novel recounts the tale about an alternate world where human society changes when they discover an underground species of intelligent Molemen, whom are promptly put to the service of mankind and forced to work in the mining industry for the enrichment of humanity. As the years pass, the Molemen begin to organize themselves as they learn more and more about human society and quickly advance their own civilization, as humanity keeps looking down on them. The Molemen, tired of the mistreatment and filled with resentment, rebel against humanity, and launch a global war for supremacy, as they want to bring down the surface world and everything it has achieved.\n\nMany critics have praised the novel, considering a masterpiece of our times. The political allusions found inside haven't gone unseen either, as many consider the book clearly inspired by the Sudeten German tensions that have affected our country, and compared the revanchist Molemen with Germany's own ambitions in Europe. Even more apparent given that Germany has almost immediately banned the book inside their borders."

cze.49.t:0 "Anti-Germany Comics Angers Diplomats"
cze.49.d:0 "With the rise of Valkism in Germany, the ambitions of the clearly revanchist and irredentist German government have not gone without notice. What has been impossible to miss is the fact that the leader of the Valkists and German Führer, Adam Dressler, was actually born in our country. Of Sudeten German origin, this fact has caught the attention of many Czechs, and while some worry he might eventually push his ambitions in the Sudetenland, others consider this possibility ridiculous, and have began mocking Dressler.\n\nOne of the most notorious examples of this, that has angered German diplomats, who have asked us to censure the spread of the image in question, is a political comic depicting Adam Dressler, crying like a lost boy as he asks the whereabouts of his home, referring to the Sudetenland. While we can't deny the piece's wit, it might be prudent to care about diplomacy."

cze.50.d:0 "While we have done our part in stabilizing our nation and working towards a new age for our nation, not everyone has felt integrated in our recovery process since the civil war.\n\nThe Sudeten Germans, who correspond to roughly one third of our population after the Slovak left us, have become increasingly unhappy living under Czech rule, yet they are too big of a minority to ignore. Earlier today, strikes began in parts of the Sudetenland, as Sudeten German workers are unhappy with the little representation they feel they have. This has extended to the political groups, as different Sudeten German politicians and movements have given them support, and the matter of Sudeten autonomy has become an issue for our government."
cze.50.a:0 "We'll see about it."
cze.51.t:0 "Concessions for the Germans?"
cze.51.d:0 "As the strikes persist, we have come to realize giving concessions to the Sudeten workers and cooperating with their leaders might be a solution that will calm them down, specially in the face of a growing Sudeten German autonomist movement. On the other hand, giving in to their demands might end up weakening our recovering nation even more, something we clearly not need."
cze.51.a:0 "Grant them concessions."
cze.51.b:0 "They should just work."
cze.52.t:0 "The Rise of Sudeten Valkists"
cze.52.d:0 "It's no secret that the leader of the valkist regime in Germany is of Sudeten German origin. Thus, it's not a surprise that valkist ideas would grow amonst the most radical and extreme of the Sudeten Germans. Lead by known Adam Dressler's admirer Konrad Henlein (some even say that Henlein has tried to imitate Dressler's appearance), the Sudetendeutsche Volksfront has established as the most radical nationalist movement in all of the Sudetenland. Even some Sudeten German worry at this new development, as Henlein's band of thugs seems to threaten both short and long-term peace in the region."
cze.52.a:0 "Oh god no."
cze.53.t:0 "The German Democratic Front"
cze.53.d:0 "As extremist groups rise and cause chaos in the Sudetenland, not everyone is happy at this. Thus, the Sudeten-Czech Democratic Front has arisen.

Certainly a group we want in our side."

cze.54.d:0 "Increasingly polarized and divided, yet increasingly chaotic in a homogeneous fashion, Sudetenland has sunk into some of its darkest periods, threatening the stability of the Czech State.\n\nDifferent nationalist groups have taken to the streets to vandalize and cause chaos as they spread their message of hate and anti-czech sentiment. Meanwhile, newly revitalized the workers have taken to the streets, and even the democratic front has spread its pro-autonomy agenda all over the region. We have to do something."

cze.55.d:0 "It's well known that since back in the Czechoslovakia days, the Czech domination of society and government has been strong. Now, in the titular Czech State, it remains the case. Yet as the Sudeten German want to feel represented and given autonomy, the matter of Language has arisen. Rather than be forced to learn Czech, they want to be taught German in schools and be able to use it in official government matters. While this could certainly make a lot of Sudeten Germans happy, some worry this might weaken the unity of our nation."
cze.55.a:0 "Germans will be official in the Sudetenland."

cze.56.t:0 "Peace in the Sudetenland"
cze.56.d:0 "While sunk in chaos for months, the Sudetenland is finally returning to peace. As our government was able to deal with different Sudeten political actors and, through the granting of autonomies, peacify the Sudeten movement, the radical movements have shrunk almost to nill, and the Sudeten people can finally feel as integral members of our Nation. It seems stability is coming to Czechia."
cze.56.a:0 "Today, we all are Czechs."
cze.57.t:0 "A Radical Proposal"
cze.57.d:0 "Feeling unrepresented in the Czech State, and in sight of the increasing troubles and chaos that has spread through the Sudetenland, the united Sudeten movements have come to us with a proposal. As Sudetenland within Czechia doesn't seem to be working that well, they ask for a referendum. While not everyone wants to leave Czechia and join the radical regime that is Germany, a lot of Sudeten Germans do. Thus, by allowing for a referendum, we could possibly gain the legitimacy of the Sudeten German, assuming we have won their support and they vote to stay in Czechia. The downside, of course, is the chance that the Sudeten Germans decide to leave, splitting our nation even further. Certainly an intriguing choice."

cze.59.t:0 "Sudetenland in Chaos"
cze.59.d:0 "While the Democratic Front has deeply regreted our decision, it seems that we will regret it even more, as radicalized by our decision, the different Sudeten German movements have taken it to the streets, as the Sudetenland is in absolute chaos and the radical groups take over."

Now, that Germany has fallen into radical nationalism, and this crisis seems poised to strengthen Germany while weakening our hold on continental europe, standing up with Czechia and supporting them and their territorial integrity, deterring possible German aggression, seems like the most sound choice to make, although Germany won't really like it one bit."

Now the valkists in Sudetenland, under the Sudetendeutsche Volksfront, lead by Konrad Henlein, known admired of our Führer, have decided unilaterally their intentions to secede from Czechia and reunite with the homeland. Sudetenland is the Führer's birthplace, as well, so union would be something that he very much desires.\n\nThe imperialist French, however, have decided otherwise, and in a not surprising move, have decided to openly support and defend their puppet's territorial integrity.

cze.65.d:0 "In sight of the ongoing crisis, and how it dangers the territorial integrity of our nation, France has decided to stand with us, supporting our integrity fully. This will hopefully ensure that Germany doesn't try to do anything weird, at least for now."
cze.65.a:0 "Let's hope so."
cze.66.t:0 "France Abandons Us"
cze.66.d:0 "It seems that the Great War has left the French utterly afraid of the slightest threat, as in a shocking show of cowardice, the French, who were supposed to be our allies and stand with us, able declined to vocally support our national integrity and stand with us, ostensibly at fear of incurring Germany's wrath. These are dark times for the Czechs."
cze.66.a:0 "Goddamn it."

cze.67.t:0 "The Pacification of Sudetenland"
cze.67.d:0 "As our troops have marched and spread throught the Sudetenland, peace is finally returning to the region. Paramilitary groups have been arrested, and dissidents are being dealt with. Now we can only hope we can go on and leave this crisis behind, as stability can finally be found once again, now without the radical groups in power."
cze.67.a:0 "Stability? Finally?!"
cze.68.t:0 "The Language Issue"
cze.68.d:0 "As a Czech national state, the matter of Czech language being the prime one has always been known. Sadly, Sudeten Germans have't liked having to learn the language one bit, when it's the language this country runs at. While learning it is essential for integration, some consider that we might go a little oppressive in our languages policies. This is of course, absurd, but we still need to have a solid statement about our language policy."
cze.68.a:0 "German is permitted in everyday, but Czech is official for government."
cze.68.b:0 "Keep German in the houses, only Czech can be used anywhere else."
cze.69.t:0 "Germany Comes for Sudetenland"
cze.69.d:0 "As the radical Sudeten German movement secedes unilaterally and threatens our territorial integrity, Germany has heard them and has come for them. We don't stand alone, however. At the face of German aggression, the French, and the Continental Entente, support us. It seems like the fate of Europe will be decided in the battlefield, if we refuse their demands. But we won't lose faith, even in these dare times."
cze.69.a:0 "Verni Zustaneme!"
cze.70.t:0 "Extremists Radicalize Further"
cze.70.d:0 "Ostensibly in reaction to our forceful approach towards estabishing a secure Sudetenland, the radical Sudeten German groups have grown. With increased popular support, their paramilitary wings have risen and began fighting our men all around the Sudetenland, as the Sudeten German stand in open aggression against us."
cze.70.a:0 "Fighting will get them nowhere."
cze.71.t:0 "Sudetenland in Chaos"
cze.71.d:0 "As the Sudeten German terrorists persist and the violence increases, all of Sudetenland is now firmly sunken in chaos, as we lose control over it, our men are still fighting for it. Chaos like this, it hasn't been seen since the civil war. As expected, the Sudetendeutsche Volksfront is the main of these rebellious groups."
cze.71.a:0 "The Czechs won't give up his time!"

cze.80.t:0 "Czechia petitions to join the Entente"
cze.80.d:0 "A close friend of ours for years now, Czechia might not be quite the state that it was before, but it still has mantained notoriously strong ties with us, and cooperated with France through all these years.\n\nGiven notice of the increasingly radicalized geopolitical situation in Europe, they have asserted that working together for defense might be the best option, and as we have helped them already through all this time, it's only logical to formalize our ties into a formal alliance, and integrate them into the Entente, that's why they have petitioned to join us."
cze.80.a:0 "Let's formalize our alliance."
cze.80.b:0 "It's not in our interests."
cze.81.t:0 "France accepts us"
cze.81.d:0 "We have received official word from the French diplomats. France has decided to let us join the Continental Entente. Now we can properly stand secure as we focus on defending Europe from troublemakers, as part of the Entente."
cze.81.a:0 "Great News!"
cze.82.t:0 "France Rejects Us"
cze.82.d:0 "Terrible news arrive, as it seems that the French, for whichever selfish reason, maybe even fear, have decided that letting us into their alliance is now what they want. The future of Czechia is uncertain, as we stand alone today."
cze.82.a:0 "Never should have trusted the frogs."
cze.83.t:0 "Czechia wants to join the International"
cze.83.d:0 "The young Czech Commune is a recent revolutionary government in Central Europe. They have decided that to ensure their survival they need our help, and they might work as a platform for the revolution in Europe. Of course they aren't quite big, so it might be wise to consider whether we want them as part of our alliance."
cze.83.a:0 "Let them in."
cze.83.b:0 "We don't need them."
cze.84.t:0 "Russia accepts us"
cze.84.d:0 "We have received official word from the Soviet diplomats. The Russian government has decided that they will allow us to  join the International. Now we can properly stand secure as we the revolution stands strong and united as it spreads through Europe."
cze.84.a:0 "Great News!"
cze.85.t:0 "Russia Rejects Us"
cze.85.d:0 "Terrible news arrive, as it seems that the Soviet, for whichever selfish reason, maybe even fear, have decided that letting us into their alliance is now what they want. The future of Czechia is uncertain, as we stand alone today."
cze.85.a:0 "They don't care for internationalism nor the revolution."
cze.90.t:0 "Reinforcing Our Nation"
cze.90.d:0 "As we leave behing the different issues that have unstabilized our nation, Czechia can finally work towards building up and improving itself, finding its place in the world, and advance, as we know that a conflict might be coming to Europe in the future, as international tensions have increased quickly over time, and the world is thrown away."
cze.90.a:0 "We'll try our best."
cze.91.t:0 "A Red Plot?"
cze.91.d:0 "A confidential report has been submitted by forces stationed around the north of our country, stating that evidence has been found of underground socialist activity, around the area of Mladá Boleslav, a known socialist stronghold during the revolution in '31. While nothing has been enacted openly yet, this is a dangerous precedent.\n\nLuckily for us, no one knows of this information, and to the public eye, everything is peaceful. Let's hope this report turns out to be just rumours, and we don't have to worry about them."
cze.91.a:0 "We'll keep our eyes open."
cze.92.t:0 "Where's Democracy?"
cze.92.d:0 "These recent times we have seen a new era of stability and quiet in Czechia, yet it seems like this internal peace has, ironically enough, triggered new agitations. Pro-Democracy groups formed by supported of all political parties have began campaigning for the return of democracy to Czechia. And with good reason, they see no necessity the military government anymore, as we find ourselves with internal peace.\n\nHowever, not all is what it seems, and Czechia could easily fall into disarray again given the wrong situation. We need to consider carefully, even if they are right in that they have waited a lot for democracy to return."
cze.92.a:0 "Democracy will return, we are calling for elections in a few months."
cze.92.b:0 "It's not the right time."
cze.93.t:0 "The Nationalist Front Appears"
cze.93.d:0 "Ever since Czechoslovakia fell, there have been a lot of people claiming its fall was a mistake and that Czechia should seek to reunify with Slovakia. Mainly Pan-slavists, a force that was strong in the birth of Czechoslovakia, they found themselves quite lost once the Czechoslovak dream died.\n\nThat changed now, as the Czechoslovak Nationalist Front, a faction of radicalized far right-wing pan-slavists, lead by General Radola Gajda, with quite open ambitions of reviving the Czechoslovak dream and establishing radical nationalist policies in our country. Openly critics of the failures of the military government, that was unable to keep Slovakia, and that as they claim, have kept the growth of Czechia stumped, they have announced they will run in the upcoming elections.\n\nRunning on a clearly revanchist platform, we'll see how this will affect the future political developments in our nation."
cze.93.a:0 "The Fall of Czechoslovakia was a mistake."
cze.93.b:0 "Let's hope they don't cause too much trouble."
cze.94.t:0 "Parties prepare their campaigns"
cze.94.d:0 "As the upcoming elections approach, the different political parties that have awaited for their time have began their campaigns to obtain popular support and possibly win the elections, that will be both presidential and parliamentary.\n\nThe Czech Social Democratic Party, that has gone great length to dissociate itself from the old Social Democratic Party, that went on to become the Collectivist Party, has proposed a wide range of social reforms and increased interventionist measures to create a truly social economy. While quite concise in its proposals, many fear it's just a party for closeted Collectivists.\n\nThe Czech Party of Farmers and Peasants, colloquially known as the Agrarian Party, representing many of the interests of agrarian groups, as well as friend to big business, is a rather promising candidate, although it hasn't reached the support they had found in Czechoslovakia, where the old party had a lot of its main supporters in Slovakia.\n\nMeanwhile, the Czech National Social party, nominally socialist, but in fact an ostensibily national-liberal party, has began its own campaign too, and while its proposals aren't very radical nor far reaching, they have found themselves comfortable as a center option.\n\nFinally, the Czech National Democracy, a more right-wing oriented national-conservative party, has built a following on nostalgia and traditionalist policies that they hope to reach to the people missing the good old days."
cze.94.a:0 "Certainly an interesting roster."
cze.95.t:0 "The Red Plot reveals itself"
cze.95.d:0 "As we discovered months ago, the underground socialist activity was in fact a signal of something bigger. Small strikes in key cities along Bohemia have appeared today, as well as newfound vandalism in Prague, as it seems that the wanna-be revolutionaries are up to no good."
cze.95.a:0 "Time to clean them up."
cze.96.t:0 "Nationalists face Socialists"
cze.96.d:0 "As we weren't able to succesfully put an end to all of the socialist activity, it seems that the Nationalist Front was able to. The Front's paramilitary wing, clearly inspired by the Czechoslovak Legions, have began fighting against Collectivist in the streets across different cities. While the incidents have remained small-scale, this certainly puts them in a positive light for a lot of people, who aren't too keen on the Collectivists, specially before the elections."
cze.96.a:0 "At least it's some help."
cze.97.t:0 "Elections of [GetYear]"
cze.97.d:0 "The time has come, democracy is around the corner, as elections have come to our country. Finally will the fate of Czechia be decided, as the Czech people can vote on their leaders."
cze.97.a:0 "The Social Democrats win."
cze.97.b:0 "The Agrarians win."
cze.97.c:0 "The National Social Party wins."
cze.97.e:0 "The National Democrats win."
cze.97.f:0 "The Nationalist Front wins?"
cze.98.t:0 "The Social Democratic Victory"
cze.98.d:0 "Running on a wide social program, and with a simple idea; A Social Democracy has no need for Collectivism, the Czech Social Democratic Party, lead by Antonín Hampl, thus has won the elections, and will lead the new democratic government, as a new age begins for Czechia."
cze.98.a:0 "May we leave the past behind forever."
cze.99.t:0 "The Agrarian Victory"
cze.99.d:0 "With moderate social proposals and with a program that was able to reach people all around Czechia, the Czech Party of Farmers and Peasants was able to claim victory in the elections, and its leader, Rudolf Beran, in now our new president. May this signify the rise of a new Czechia."
cze.99.a:0 "I sure love democracy."
cze.100.t:0 "The National Social Victory"
cze.100.d:0 "A return to liberal policies that Czechoslovakia had and a healthy national consciousness, that's what the Czech National Social Party promised, and apparently it was enough to win, as our new president is its leader, Edvard Beneš, who has promised a new age for Czechia."
cze.100.a:0 "It was a great choice."
cze.101.t:0 "The National Democrat Victory"
cze.101.d:0 "A clearly very conservative and traditional party, the National Democrats might have possibly got their main source of support in their clear affiliation with panslavism, something that other parties have generally avoiding commenting on. Nonetheless, they will certainly provide a strong start for our new democratic age."
cze.101.a:0 "Magnificent!"
cze.102.t:0 "The Czechoslovak Nationalist Front wins"
cze.102.d:0 "Panic spreads through the democratic groups, as the revanchist pan-slavist and ultra-nationalist Czechoslovak Nationalist Front has attained victory in the elections, with a popularity base amongst those that feel our nation has been wronged and failed by convential politicians, and that seek a new age for Czechia, and maybe even beyond that.\n\nThis is certainly a worrying result, and while we can only hope that the fact they won democratic elections mean anything, it seems likely democracy might die as soon as it returned."
cze.102.a:0 "Bože!"
cze.103.t:0 "The Red Plot revealed"
cze.103.d:0 "As wide anti-junta protests spread through Czechia, it seems the information we received not long ago was right, as now Collectivist cells seem to have revealed themselves, joining into the anti-junta movement, and quickly growing from disillusioned members of the democratic front.\n\nWe need to handle this situation before it escalates further."
cze.103.a:0 "Station our men, we stopped one revolution, we can do the same again."
cze.104.t:0 "Demonstrations Escalate"
cze.104.d:0 "As we have put our efforts into stopping the heightened demonstrations, it seems that while the democratic front has weakened in their attempts, the illegal Collectivist Front has not done the same, rather using their underground connections to avoid many of our men. Meanwhile, widespread strikes have appeared all over Czechia, as it seems we might need to use additional force."
cze.104.a:0 "This has to stop, shoot the workers."
cze.104.b:0 "Mantain our position."
cze.105.t:0 "The General Strike"
cze.105.d:0 "As we have began using violence against many of the workers and political dissidents, socialists or not, it seems like we have only dug ourselves into a deeper hole.\n\nA General Strike has been called as the streets of Prague, Brno, and cities all over Czechia are filled with violence and chaos, our men are stretched thin, and it seems like some of our units aren't responding to our orders.\n\nChaos has increased further, as the nationalist front has taken to the streets to openly fight the socialists, and violence seems to fill each side of our society. This is revolution."

Memories from the First Revolution are to be found, but this time, the good side won. No more will the workers of Czechia have to endure the cruelties of the Bourgouise Dictatorship, nor the liberal "democracy", nor any other! A new dictatorship of the proletariat will be established!

It lead Czechia into decadence and eternal strife. No more! The rule of the people needs to be unified under a strong leadership, where nothing can be questioned, and where the loyalties to the nation can not be questioned.\n\nThus has General Radola Gadja stated as his mission, as his clique of military allies, as well as the paramilitary and civil forces of the Nationalist Front have taken over the central leadership of the nation, and will now take control over the country that has fallen into chaos."

cze.108.t:0 "Fighting Against Chaos"
cze.108.d:0 "As our men clash with the radicalized population in different parts of our country, we have been able to gain some ground, as the insurrectionist forces are slowing their advance, it seems like we will be able to push them back completely.\n\nWelp, I guess the junta is staying for a while, as Czechia isn't yet ready for a non-military government."
cze.108.a:0 "To Arms."
cze.109.t:0 "Back into our nation"
cze.109.d:0 "After being abandoned to our fate, the German vultures robbed us from the Sudetenland.\n\nNow, it is clear to our nation. The military government, that for so long stayed in power claiming to have Czechia's best interests in mind, has failed us. They had swore to defend Czechia, the survival of our nation, after the collapse of our old dream, yet they weren't able to even do this. As rage fills the hearts of many Czechs, strikes have began all over Czechia, as we have reached our direst hour yet again."
cze.109.a:0 "Oh no."
cze.110.t:0 "The Second Revolution"
cze.110.d:0 "Enemies of the Junta, many different underground Collectivist groups have resurfaced, and they have allied with members of democratic political parties, that upset at the Junta, have began a massive insurrection. Violence spreads as this Revolutionary Front has began a new age of conflict for Czechia.\n\nMeanwhile, not even between ourselves we are sure of who is friend and who is enemy, as rumours abound that disloyal officers plan to topple our regime."
cze.110.a:0 "This isn't good."
cze.111.t:0 "The Nationalist Front Joins the Struggle"
cze.111.d:0 "Formed by ultra-nationalists, many of them Pan-slavists, who have claimed for long a militarist, revanchist attitude after the loss of Slovakia, and the need to restore our nation to glory, the recent loss of Sudetenland has proven them right even more, as they have taken a strong position against the military government, considering it weak and failed, and blaming it for sinking our nation. It seems that the right-wing of our nation has strongly aligned with the movement, as its paramilitary forces wage war with the Revolutionary Force, it seems like we truly have no friends left, and our days are counted."

Those with strong ties to the dictatorship, or to dangerous nationalist agendas must be eliminated. Some however, show no real ties with any political affiliation, and maybe could be useful for rebuilding our armed forces, although some argue only those that have sweared loyalty to our new, people's government, should stay."

Maybe the government is trying to hard, what if people decided by themselves?

cze.131.d:0 "One of the leading members of the party's central committee, and one of our best men, Rudolf Slánský didn't show himself yesterday. While of immediate concern to his family, today it is a concern for everyone, as one of the most important leaders of our country has seemingly gone missing off the face of the earth.\n\nTheories about his whereabouts abound, ranging from more down to earth ones, including possible accidents on his way home, to more sensationalistic, like what if reactionary spies are kidnapping or murdering our brave leaders. One thing is for sure, an investigation must be done."

cze.132.t:0 "An Investigator's Request"
cze.132.d:0 "As the investigation proceeds, much of comrade Slánský's day to day and his pathing between work and home has been tracked and is being used as a basis for the investigation scene. While that side is proceeding as by the norm, an investigator has submitted a request to the party. Allow the investigation to extend his reach into the party's offices, as that could possibly allow clues about his immediate behavior before heading home to be found.\n\nWhile an intriguing thought, maybe it's not the best idea to allow any non-party officer to investigate there."

Looking for possible incidents happening the night he disappeared, mentions of events are little, although probing the people living around the road might be a good start for possible clues.\n\nAlternatively, a more off-road approach might be preferable, in case that leads to finding anything, although unlikely."

cze.134.t:0 "The Interrogations"
cze.134.d:0 "Asking the people in the localities around the road Slánský used to take, we have found that the night itself was calm, and there was no signs of anything unusual happening. It seems that whatever might have happened to Slánský, it wasn't while travelling home."
cze.134.a:0 "Well bollocks."
cze.135.t:0 "The Off-Road Direction"
cze.135.d:0 "As we have focused our efforts into investigating any off-road incidents Slánský might have suffered, for most of the week we found little evidence of anything in the zone off-road happening. There is still ground to cover, but it's looking unlikely that we'll find anything. In the meanwhile, public pressure to solve this investigation has increased, as radical theories grow in the public mind, some even blaming it in a possible conspiracy by the party itself. We must solve this soon."

Meanwhile, pubic pressure continues to grow, as radical theories about the disappearance are more popular with each passing day, some of the most extreme ones even putting the blame on a ridiculous party and government. We must solve this investigation soon."

cze.137.t:0 "A Possible Solution?"
cze.137.d:0 "As we finish searching most of the off-road zone, our investigators have come across something extremely interesting. A rather recent crashed car, with the body of a dead male inside. While we have confirmed that the man in question isn't Slánský, members of the committee have suggested a radical proposal.\n\nLet's say that the crash we found is Slánský, alter the evidence and make sure no one knows who it is actually, and use this succesful investigation to regain some of the popularity we lost in the incident.\n\nMany however, consider this morally questionable, and maybe we just have to embrace the fact, that we don't know where Slánský is."

But we know one thing, that with the inefficient investigation run by the Czech Police we won't ever find the truth.\n\nThus, the Central Committee of the Collectivist Party has drafted a solution to the issue of incompetence. A new police and security apparatus, distinct to the standard police forces, directly responsible to the party itself. This new State Security force, the Státní Bezpečnost, or StB, will make sure cases like this don't happen again. We will know everything that happens, they will be our eyes and hands inside the country. Nothing will be able to challenge the party anymore."

Finally the workers have made their dream real, and brought socialism and the workers' rule to all of Czechoslovakia, as we were supposed to years ago.\n\nThus we have reorganized our country in view of our newfound success, creating the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic, and uniting them in a socialist federation, therefore known as the Union of Czech and Slovak Socialist Republics, or the UCSSR.\n\nCrowds gather and march in pride, waving their revolutionary flags in the streets of both Prague and Bratislava, as the birth of a greater socialist nation in Europe takes place. Still, there is much to be done in the integration of the new federal territories, but socialism will be properly implemented in Slovakia, and all of the Union."

cze.141.d:0 "As the investigator searched through the office for information about comrade Slánský's last day, he was surprised to find Slánský's belongings having clearly been moved and altered in place, likely by the cleaning crew.\n\nNonetheless he looked across his files and scheduling for anything that might have come up last minute. Nothing weird was to be found in his desk, after all.\n\nAs he prepared to leave, for some reason, he thought it might have been a good idea to sneak around and look for possible files that might have been moved in other rooms. He found a file in a trash can in office next door to Slánský's, a scheduling one that seemed to belong to the comrade's desk but was thrown out for some reason. It featured a planned meeting between Slánský and chairman Gottwald in the late hours of that day. What's even stranger, is that it seems that the schedule is about the same day as the one originally found at Slánský's desk, as if one of them was fake.\nWhether this story is real or not, that's what he claims, as earlier today the public was in shock as the investigator decided to make his findings public, clearly ruining the investigative process, just to make the party leadership look bad."

cze.141.b:0 "We must get rid of him."
cze.142.t:0 "Public discontent grows"
cze.142.d:0 "After the story was made public, trust in the leadership has greatly diminished. Chairman Gottwald has been the main focus of the critics, much of the media traitorously calling him corrupt, scheming, and colluding, putting his interests over the people's, and clearly being responsible for the disappearance.\n\nAn official response about the situation has been made, claiming that the schedule found and taken by the investigator is a forgery, made by reactionary forces to threaten our stability, or possibly even by the investigator himself.

cze.145.d:0 "As now even the comrade's family has joined in stating they blame the party's leadership on the disappearance of Slánský, the Chairman has found himself isolated, with many of the most prominent party leaders declining to show any ties to him, as the media has put him on the spotlight for the so-called corruption case. It seems like there is no turning back from this now."

While we can only hope this doesn't hurt the party as a whole, a new provisional government has been established by the central committe, as we hope to grow beyond Gottwald's corrupt influences."

cze.147.t:0 "The People's Army Coup"
cze.147.d:0 "Surrounded by enemies, the chairman saw no other option. To put his henchmen to use as he signed an order to get rid of much of the party leadership. As the Purge was soon to begin, Gottwald's insidious scheme was stopped by the People's Army, that, in a show of determination, and standing against the growing corruption in the party's bureaucrats, has couped the government, putting a military government in charge of the party, as a provisional measure to set our country back on track towards socialism.\n\nWhether experienced General Svoboda or the more ambitious Richard Tesařík leads the newly formed government, is to be seen."

cze.144.d:0 "Not everyone has been quite happy after we took over the reins of the nation. Mainly traitorous socialists, as well as groups that don't value our mission nor goals. It wasn't surprising these undesirable individuals would try to hurt us, and they have done so, bombing some of our industrial centers in Bohemia, hurting our nation's capabilities. While this is nothing we can't recover for, it might be a good idea to send our men to deal with these traitorous groups, find them, and get rid of them for good, although if we don't do so our standard security forces might get rid of them as well, but not before they hurt us further."

Through fair conquest, valiant war effort, our nation has recovered its missing half, the territories of Slovakia, a fundamental part of the Czechoslovak nation. Separated by traitors and foreign interests, we have succeeded in unifying our nation, and we won't let anyone take it away ever again, as we stand with greatness and strength.\n\nBut today, we celebrate. Our people is united, our nation has been reborn stronger than ever. The superiority of the slavic kind has been shown to the world, as Panslavism and Czechoslovakism triumph. Now, it's time to bringing our newly found half up to date.\n\nWidely celebrated were Vůdce [Root.GetLeader]'s words, as well as the whole event."

cze.148.t:0 "The Front For Czechia"
cze.148.d:0 "After some very persuasive negotiations, we have managed to formally establish the Front For Czechia. A wide-ranging political movement with the purpose of forming a base of support for our regime, that has for too long been considered unpopular. While much is to be done to gain popular support, this is an important first step.\n\nLeaders of the several unofficial parties that have spread their ideas and campaigned for democracy have wisely decided to give us their support, amongst the most vocal ones is Rudolf Beran. Others have been less vocal, but have still wisely decided to cooperate with us."

After the investigation put us in such a bad light, we can't allow information just to be taken like that. The truth is, we can't trust an entity like the Police to investigate matters so relevant to the state as the disappearance of a member of the party leadership.\n\nThat's why we are founding a new state security force to be our eyes and hands, and make sure this never ever happens again. The Státní Bezpečnost, or StB, will bring us stability and strengthen the party, and loyalty to it. And what better use of it, than to get rid of all those traitors bad-mouthing the party leadership right now."

cze.150.d:0 "As another day passes, the investigator has finally arrived to investigate the party's offices and seek clues about the missing comrade's behavior and whereabouts. However, a lot of tension has been developed amonst the uneasy party leadership, for some reason. He has requested to be given at least 6 hours to investigate, but that's considered by many too much, claiming 3 hours might be a better amount, and more than enough."
cze.150.a:0 "Let him take his time."
cze.150.b:0 "Just 3 hours."
cze.151.t:0 "Nothing conclusive in the offices"
cze.151.d:0 "As expected, the investigator wasn't able to find anything conclusive while searching the offices, and thus has decided to move towards investigating Slánský's pathing home. Maybe he'll find something useful there."

cze.160.t:0 "Dissent in the public"
cze.160.d:0 "The new regime that has risen in Czechia, while clearly driven to make the dreams of the Czech people alive, has been quite divisive. Both whatever is left of the scrambling socialist revolutionaries, as well as opposition forces that are linked to liberal democratic movements that had poisoned Czechoslovakia so long ago, have set their sights on destabilizing our government.\n\nWhile we won't let that happen, as our legions will get rid of any enemies of the nation, that's not enough, as we must bolster the loyalties our people feel towards its nation, aside from dealing with the dissidents.\n\nOur glorious Vůdce has for his part decided that winning the people's hearts is first and foremost, and wishes to begin a campaign of speeches, were he will personally rally the people at different cities, to ensure he gains the masses's support.\nSome of the leading members of the front claim this is a very dangerous idea in the current political climate, and have suggested to the Vůdce that instead we should focus on expanding some of our paramilitary forces into a stronger security force, capable of silencing any opposition, thus allowing us to easily control the national populace. While he personally disliked the idea, seeing the clear parallels between such organization and the German TST, he has granted the fact that it might be useful."
cze.160.a:0 "Only the Vůdce can give the people what they want."

cze.161.t:0 "Rally at Prague"
cze.161.d:0 "From our national capital, a new spirit of national rebirth will expand. Soon all of Czechia will have their hearts and souls filled with the fervor of making our collective dreams true once again.\n\nThis is the sentiment our Vůdce tried to evoke in our first rally. With possible enemies of the state expected, things overall went rather well, as our forces had secured every corner, and the masses moved with the legions, united as the national flags waved, and the crowd cheered for Gajda.\n\nA pretty succesful beginning to our political campaign, we can feel as our nation is better aligning to our nationalist government."
cze.161.a:0 "We'll expand from Prague, to all of Czechoslovakia!"
cze.162.t:0 "Rally at Plzeň"
cze.162.d:0 "One of the most contentious locations for a rally, and possibly one of the most strategic ones, Gajda decided that Plzeň, straddling the Sudetenland border, would be the setting.\n\nAs Sudeten German nationalists, opposing everything our national dream stands for, were expected, we found nothing of that. Instead, some demonstrations of liberal and socialist dissidents were protesting as the Vůdce's convoy was arriving at the city. They were promptly arrested, and we identified both ethnic Czechs and Sudeten Germans amongst them.\n\nAfter that, the rally proceeded succesfully, with a strong anti-Germany rethoric being the core of the Vůdce's speech. This resulted very popular with most of the city's population."
cze.162.a:0 "That could have gone worse."
cze.163.t:0 "Demonstrations at Brno"
cze.163.d:0 "As our campaign proceeds, the planned location of Brno was specially important for the Vůdce's consideration, and is set to be the place of the next rally.\n\nA rock has appeared in front of our path, however, as increasingly radicalized opposition forces have began protests at Brno, quite bigger than the ones we faced at Plzeň. While our forces are quite possibly capable of dealing with them, proceeding immediately with the event might be very dangerous as a divided city full of dissidents to be actively handled might put our Vůdce's wellbeing at risk. He, however, has stated he won't let dissidents stop his national campaign. Still, many consider waiting a few days before proceeding might be best for national security."
cze.163.a:0 "Weak unpatriotic traitors won't stop the Vůdce."
cze.163.b:0 "We must wait for the situation to be handled."
cze.164.t:0 "Rally at Brno"
cze.164.d:0 "With most of our legions in place to defend the Vůdce in the highly contentious location for his speech, minor riots occurred at the streets, however, they were quickly put down. The radical demonstrations shifting a lot of the silent population of the city towards the Vůdce in reaction, they helped fight against any possible dissenters.\n\nThe Vůdce himself focused on divisions, and overcoming the unstability that traitors have placed Czechia at, as well as reflecting the historical nature of the city, as the Treaty of Brno ended the Czechoslovak dream, Brno itself will help reigite the flame that propells our people towards achieving that dream once again.\n\nAfter finishing, due to security concerns, the Vůdce promptly leaved the city, as it seems he was right after all, the traitors weren't able to stop him, and loyalty to him is strengthened."
cze.164.a:0 "The Vůdce was right."
cze.165.t:0 "Rally at Ostrava"
cze.165.d:0 "As he finishes his national campaign, the Vůdce has reached his last location, the eastern town of Ostrava.\n\nIt seems national sentiment is clearly supporting the Vůdce in all matters, as most of the population of the almost-border town attended proudly the rally, the Vůdce's speech, dedicated to the future of the Czechs, clearly reached the people's hearts. A march quickly followed, and the rally was a great success.\n\nAs the Vůdce planned, we have gained the loyalty of the Czechs."
cze.165.a:0 "We are all together in this."
cze.166.t:0 "Rally at Brno."
cze.166.d:0 "After waiting a few days, our forces throughly got rid of most of the demostrations and dissidents in Brno. Everything seemed to have gone well, as there was no chaos in the streets anymore, thus that meant it was secure.\n\nOr so we thought. Hidden between the masses as just another legionary, a dissident of unknown affiliation got to close distance and shot the Vůdce in the head. The crowd panicked, and the assassin was quickly shot, but it was too late. As chaos overtook the streets, the Nationalist Front quickly rose and established order in the city.\n\nNow, however, we are without our leader, and the divisions in the party are showing. One side, more supportive of the former Vůdce's direct policies and ideas, lead by Emanuel Moravec, wants to carry on with Gajda's legacy. Another faction, however, the same one that proposed setting up a stronger security force partially in the style of Germany's, and that has as such been legitimized, is gaining strength. Lead by Jan Rys-Rozsévač, whose radical ideas, proposing a different kind of absolute nationalist state, might as well be a contender to take over the government."
cze.166.a:0 "Moravec's Orthodox Gadjists win the power struggle."
cze.166.b:0 "Jan Rys-Rozsévač's reorganization ideas are what Czechia needs."
cze.167.t:0 "A Reorganized Security"
cze.167.d:0 "As we have come to the conclusion we must reorganize our security forces to properly deal with all the dissident groups in our nation, we find ourselves with quite a plan. The Legions, while loyal to us and fervent in their nationalism, aren't very well organized, working rather organically rather than under absolute control by our state. Thus Jan Rys-Rozsévač, one of the rising political members of the Nationalist Front, suggested fixing exactly that. He proposes a new reorganized Legion with a proper hierarchy, more stringent membership requirements and more professional, that works directly controlled by the state and the Vůdce. Meanwhile, a separate branch will be created amongst the most loyal and skilled from the Legions, with the purpose of ensuring security for our state and our government, and making sure any dissident activity can't even begin to grown. The Ochranný Oddíl, or OO, as Rys-Rozsévač calls them, would be heavily inspired by Germany's TST. That sole fact has made this reorganization quite divisive, given our relationship with the Germans. Rys-Rozsévač, however, has dismissed the claims that this makes us more like them, stating that we only use the system cause it works, not cause we want to be like Germany."
cze.167.a:0 "As long as it works..."
cze.168.t:0 "Inspecting the Sudetenland"
cze.168.d:0 "The Sudetenland is probably the single most contentious and unstable region of our nation. To ensure its longterm stability, a new project by the OO has been approved. Infiltration and surveillance of traitorous groups, to make them choke from the inside. We hope this plan will surely work."
cze.168.a:0 "Just the project we needed."
cze.169.t:0 "Hidden Cells in Prague"
cze.169.d:0 "It's no secret that Prague has grown some of the most influential Collectivist groups in all of Central Europe. But they are sly, and even with our national government in power, we must find them in their dirty nests, where they hide like rats, and get rid of them completely. Thus, an anti-bolshevik project has been proposed, infiltrating some of the areas of Prague that are more known for socialist tendencies, we will root out any traitors."

cze.170.t:0 "Moravian Scrutiny"
cze.170.d:0 "One of the less attended-to parts of our nation, the less central nature of Moravia might make it a good hiding place for rogue elements of our society, who are planning our downfall. It's time to bring Moravia closer to our full control, by sending the OO to deal with any possible irregularities."
cze.170.a:0 "No one can hide."
cze.171.t:0 "Traitors Succesfully Arrested"
cze.171.d:0 "After some weeks of investigation, the OO command in the Sudetenland has succesfully found and arrested the main operating dissident cells in the Sudetenland. While this has been a great success for our nation, it seems that Rys-Rozsévač has gained more influence due to this. We should keep track of that."
cze.171.a:0 "A Peaceful Sudetenland at last."
cze.172.t:0 "The Cleaning of Prague"
cze.172.d:0 "Weeks of through investigation, planned raids, chasing rats down alleys and more, have had results. Traitorous activity in Prague has diminished 96% according to the officially provided statistics. It seems Czech citizens can finally walk without fear as the streets of Prague are cleaned from the human filth that tried for so long to poison our nation, all thanks to the OO boys, of course."
cze.172.a:0 "Finally!"
cze.173.t:0 "Socialists Detained"
cze.173.d:0 "As the region of Moravia has been under strict scrutiny by the OO, undercover socialist operations, likely supported by the bolsheviks to the east, have been found. Supplied with Russian weapons, it's clear that this is an upfront to our nation's sovereignty. Nonetheless, it seems that physical evidence was sadly destroyed during the raids. At least our nation is safer, now."
cze.173.a:0 "A job well done."
cze.174.t:0 "Inner Threats?"
cze.174.d:0 "A report has come to the attention of our Vůdce. Known loyal general and ally of Gajda, Emanuel Moravec, has brought to the Vůdce claims that Rys-Rozsévač's Ochranný Oddíl might be planning something. While it has been clear to everyone that the OO's influence in our society has grown immensely, as they have come to be present in each corner of our nation, whether they have their own loyalties or not is purely speculation, and not surprising, considering Moravec's consistent distrust of Rys-Rozsévač's organization and ideas.\n\nOn the other hand, if these accusations are right, it would be best to act soon, as otherwise we might find ourselves in extreme danger, and Moravec isn't exactly unfounded in believing this. Thus we have a tough decision in our hands."
cze.174.a:0 "The OO is loyal to the Vůdce, that's for sure."
cze.174.b:0 "We must get rid of the OO before it's too late."

cze.175.t:0 "Rys-Rozsévač requests more power"
cze.175.d:0 "Today Rys-Rozsévač arrived to the Vůdce's national palace. Following nearby were his top OO units vigilant. As the growing influence of the Ochranný Oddíl is felt in our nation, he has given our leader a "request". To be granted the title of deputy Vůdce, as well as more liberties in his use of the organization. While clearly not what we wanted, the Vůdce found himself with no option but to do as requested, as the OO surrounded his seat of power. The balance of power inside our nation is shifting."
cze.175.a:0 "Rys-Rozsévač is getting the recognition he deserves."
cze.176.t:0 "Vůdce found dead"
cze.176.d:0 "Tragedy strikes our nation. As the crowd reunited in wait of the Vůdce's scheduled speech, they find themselves with no Vůdce. Instead, a grim announcement has been made.\n\nEarly this morning the OO, fulfilling its security duties, arrived at the Vůdce's residence, and found him dead. While the exact cause or way he might have died hasn't been stated, probably for security reasons, Rys-Rozsévač, acting in charge as deputy Vůdce, claims it must have been the result of a bolshevik conspiracy. He also announced three days of mourning for the departed Vůdce, followed by announcements of reorganization changes in our nation, what many expect to be him officially declaring himself Vůdce proper."
cze.176.a:0 "Terrible news."
cze.177.t:0 "The Loyalist Coup"
cze.177.d:0 "As the mourning period finishes, the announcement the deputy Vůdce has prepared has been stopped short today. The army, lead by the action of General Moravec, has enacted a coup on Rys-Rozsévač, arresting him and executing him.\n\nAn announcement by the General followed, claiming that the OO itself, in a traitorous move to ensure Rys-Rozsévač's rise to power, was behind the murder of the departed Vůdce. The Ochranný Oddíl has thus, been declared an illegal organization. With its head cut-off, it seems to have quickly began dissolving, although lower-level leaders tried to fight against the national army, but the army's forces were overwhelming, and thus the OO's regime has come to an end. May Moravec's government properly lead our nation towards the path Gajda truly wanted."
cze.177.a:0 "May Vůdce Moravec lead us.
cze.178.t:0 "The Upcoming Purge"
cze.178.d:0 "Deeply infiltrated as they are, the OO has too much influence to just annul them as if they were nothing. It's thus with subtlety that we will act. The plan is set, the Vůdce has scheduled a meeting with Rys-Rozsévač to congratulate him on his organization's achievements. Little does he know that the army will be vigilant, and as soon as he steps into the seat of power, he'll be arrested, and his organization disbanded. There's no way we can fail."
cze.178.a:0 "Time to act."
cze.179.t:0 "Rys-Rozsévač flees the country"
cze.179.d:0 "It seems that Jan Rys-Rozsévač has been alerted about our plan and, in a rather smart move, fleed the country. Theories about his potential whereabouts say it's likely he has fled to Germany, or possibly even Hungary. While we don't know where he might be, we do know two things:\nIt's time to finally get rid of the OO.\nAnd there are infiltrated OO traitors amongst our ranks.\n\nThere is some purging to be done."
cze.179.a:0 "What a messy purge it will be."
cze.180.t:0 "Rys-Rozsévač succesfully captured"
cze.180.d:0 "The trap was set. Rys-Rozsévač did not expect a thing. As he proudly walked into the national palace to talk with the Vůdce, our forces immediately stepped up and captured him. He proceeded to insult the Vůdce and, by, consequence, the nation. Typical behavior for a traitor. He was trialed right there and promptly shot.\n\nFollowing this, the OO was declared illegal, and without their leader, the organization began dispersing as any caught agent was arrested and dealt with. The Purge has began."

cze.197.d:0 "The first matter on the agenda, economic ties, was put on the spotlight. While Czechia has been able to build a strong economy based on its large industrial base, as well as ties with the stable Entente economical sphere, the Slovaks had had it rougher. With a mainly agrarian economy, it's ties with the British have helped it immensely, and after the London Stock Market Crisis, it has been quite difficult. Nonetheless, with very different productive areas, there is a lot of potential for economical ties and maybe integration.\n\nOne of the proposed ideas, is to begin trading with Slovakia in a complementary fashion, an Agricultural-Industrial kind-of deal. To make this profitable for Slovakia though, we'll need to give them a better trade margin that we do with other trade partners. While this would undoubtly be benefitial for Slovakia, and bring us together, many Czech politicians believe it goes against the best commercial interests of Czechia."

Czechia as expected had a stronger weight on the Congress, due to their better economical performance as an independent nation. The matter on the agenda however turned out quite well for us, as the Czechs agreed to benefitial trade margins with us, that will certainly help our economy get forward.
