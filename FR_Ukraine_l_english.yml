UKR_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "Following the collapse of the Russian Empire, the Ukrainian people sought to establish their own state along the Dnieper river. The German Empire briefly established a client state with the hopes of using Ukraine's vast fields to feed the Imperial Army, but was forced to evacuate the region following the German revolution in 1918. The Ukrainian People's Republic was re-established, and thrown into the chaos of the Russian Civil War. Coming out victorious against the bolsheviks, the Ukrainians seeked to distance themselves from Russia and create a unique Ukrainian identity wedged between Soviet Russia and a resurgent Germany. With tensions once more rising in Europe, Ukraine must place her bets and pick a side, or be lost to the annals of time."

###
ukraine.34.t:0 "The Economic Policy"
ukraine.34.d:0 "The Ukrainian Economy is full of capitalism and corruption, and each of our three leaders has proposed their own policy and plan for revitalizing and rebirthing the economy. \n\nKosier proposal a form of collectivisation, bringing all aspects of the economy under the control of the state. \n\nKhrushchev's proposal places a heavy emphasis on agriculture and the production of food on a nationwide scale, and a heavy level of micromanagment within the economy. \n\nMakhno proposes a radical policy of highly autonomous communes throughout Ukraine spearheaded by the peasants and workers of the region. He also wishes to sieze large ammounts of private property and distribute it back to the people."

ukraine.35.d:0 "The Ukrainian Military has always been woefully underequipped and comparatively small in relation to our neighbors. A radical change will need to be undertaken if we are to survive the many challenges that will face Ukraine in the near future. \n\nKosier wishes to create a red army loyal to the government, and not the state. Political repression, the quelling of unrest, and the defense of the nation will all be handed over to the military, creating an extremely military oriented state. \n\nKhruschev's plan includes the purging of several officers and thousands of supposedly disloyal soldiers to ensure that the army remains loyal, the formation of a national army from all areas of Ukraine meant to increase the sense of national unity, and the lending of foriegn rifle models. \n\nMakhno's proposal includes the drafting of local militias from towns across Ukraine, and the formation of 'horodyany' with the intention of defending every inch of Ukraine, should an invasion destroy the main bulk of the army."

A new foriegn policy will need to be adapted if we are to survive the upcoming years. \n\nKosier champions a 'realpolitik' stance, arguing that historical rivalries and grudges should be put aside for practical alliances against the true enemies of Ukraine. \n\nKhrushchev wishes to see a rejuvinated alliance with the Russians, and closer cooperation with the soviet government in Moscow. This comes at the risk of possibly being reincoperated into the Russian government, but Khrushchev has ensured the committee that nothing of the sort will happen. \n\nMakhno holds the most radical views, arguing that nobody can be trusted outside of Ukraine, and that alliances with foreign powers will lead only to ruin and despair."

ukraine.37.d:0 "The administration of Ukraine is sloppy and inefficient, with corruption being found in every corner. The reformation of the adminstrative department will be difficult and require radical methods. \n\nKosier wishes to impliment a policy of 'chitkist', meant to root out corruption and treachery wherever it is found at all levels of government and society. The military, of course, will be the instruments of this plan. \n\nKhrushchev wishes to follow his policy of show trials and purges meant to root out disloyalty to the party and ensure that thre is no opposition within the nation. \n\nMakhno's plan involves the commissioning of 'bluzky', a glorified death squad meant to strike fear into the hearts of the government and people alike. This plan is the most radical of the three, and Khrushchev has personally denounced the plan, calling it 'mad and insane'."
