canada.1.t:0 "Status of the Dominion"
canada.1.d:0 "Twenty-two years ago: Canada joined a war alongside Britain and the Triple Entente. This war would last for a long and bloody six years and become known as the Great War. Once the war came to a close, our promises of Autonomy from the British have clearly laid fallow. Canada and her sisters never earned more autonomy despite sacrifices in the Great war, with London citing that 'An increase in Autonomy may eventually lead to the break-up of the Empire that those in the Great War had fought and died to defend'. Canada, being one of the nations more particular about autonomy, has been discontent with a continued status quo but nonetheless prides herself on being a member of the British Empire. It is a diplomatic goal of Canada to manoeuvre their way to a nominally independent  state. \n\nIn the political landscape, things could be doing better. During the Great War, Prime minister Robert Borden created a Unionist coalition with the Liberal Party of Canada. Baffling everyone, Borden was willing to drastically lower tariffs to compromise with the Liberals; thus resulting in a continued coalition post-war. The Unionists would go on to dominate every election since the end of the Great war, resulting in large amounts of dissent from non-Unionist voters. \n\nHowever the economy is humming along well, booming even. This has allowed us to undertake large-scale resource extraction efforts; and we have many more planned and funded for a near future. Industrialization of the Interior has also been planned to be initiated within the next few years. Additionally, Immigration to the Dominions from Britain has also been a trend within the last two decades; allowing us to populate much of our empty nation. \n\nSo, why worry about politics when the Economy is running smoothly?"
canada.2.d:0 "Less than five days ago, the London Stock Market has been undergoing radical dips and rises due to revolt in India and unrest in Africa. Today, the CEO of Hatry Group, Clarence Hatry, was imprisioned along with his associates and put under investigation for mass fraud and forgery. Shortly after; the stock market plummeted due to investor confidence instantly evaporating. Mass selling followed with every corner of the Empire in turmoil.\n\nAnd thus we have the debacle that is the London Stock Market Crash."
canada.3.t:0 "The fall the Home Isles"
canada.3.d:0 "Following the catastrophe of the LSMC, Britain herself has suffered massive unrest. Trade union protests were met initially with Force from Westminster. After a series of unfortunate events, it became apparent that the unrest in Britain was far worse than anybody could've imagined. All starting with The Jarrow Marches, the situation devolved into riots in Manchester which spread across the Nation. Revolution later engulfed Britain once the Military was ordered to fire on the protesters and instead defected, only to side with the protesters instead. \n\n Many Conservative and Liberal politicians in Britain have met tragic ends, with even more horrifying photos making their way outside of what once was the United Kingdom. Stanley Baldwin and the loyalist remnants of the Royal Army have held out in the House of Commons for a period of time, before being overwhelmed and murdered by Revolutionaries. \n\n Protocol dictates that in event of a disaster in the Home isles, evacuation to Canada is necessary. Thankfully, many elements of the Royal Navy have remained loyal. The traumatized Royal family have set foot on Canadian soil, with hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing to Canada. What British politicians were able to avoid meeting a horrible end have also fled to Canada..."
canada.4.t:0 "Socialist Protests"
canada.4.d:0 "The London stock market crash has affected the lives of every citizen more than we could've ever imagined. Poverty is widespread and jobs are few. One area more particularly affected by the LSMC is Vancouver. In the area many workers have been laid off by their employers in an attempt to cut costs, and those who haven't been laid-off have had their wages slashed. It appears in downtown Vancouver many of these workers have begun to protest against various buisnesses... It quickly escalated to destruction of property and assault on various owners of buisnesses. \n\n These animals might further radicalize if we don't intervene and end this now, let alone having to account for cost of damages concerning these properties."
canada.5.t:0 "SoCred Recovery Plan"
canada.5.d:0 "The SoCreds have looked at the London Stock Market Crash as an opportunity to finally implement Social Credit on a federal level. They seem to have put together a thoroughly detailed plan on which initiatives should be taken to combat the economic decline caused by the LSMC. J.H Blackmore proposed it to us today. It goes without saying that this plan involves the implementation of Social Credit in various provinces, albeit on a much more modest scale. However it is entirely possible they will use this as a method to gain traction and popularity in the next elections."
canada.6.d:0 "Today has been an... 'Eventful' day in the House of Commons. Ever since we've been hit by the LSMC, our Unionist Government has been more divided than ever. Liberal aligned MPs have advocated 'waiting out' the economic crisis in an attempt to preserve a Laissez-Faire economic policy, whilst the Tory aligned MPs have demanded that we initiate Economic Intervention immediately. R.B Bennett has decided that, should no action be taken, it will only be a matter of time before the Unionist Coalition collapses... However whatever choice he would make would no doubt infuriate the other side. Today: Bennett has made his decision on which side he supports. In the House of Commons, he had this to say; \n\n 'I am for reform. And, in my mind, reform means Government intervention. It means government control and regulation. It means the end of laissez-faire.' \n\n And then there was uproar."
canada.7.d:0 "The last two weeks have been some of the most stressful ones that R.B Bennett has had to deal with in his entire life. Keeping the Unionist Coalition together was difficult enough, and now he had to deal with the London Stock Market Crash. Coupled with this, the former unhappy Liberal aligned MPs were now furious with him. He certainly hasn't had it easy lately. \n\n And as it turns out, he has succumbed to stress. Today he was discovered dead in his bathtub, after suffering a heart attack. "
canada.700.d:0 "Today it seems that the Unionist coalition has finally lost cohesion. It became very apparent that this was be unavoidable after the LSMC. The Tories and Liberals had differing views on how to effectively respond to the LSMC and it inspired furious internal arguing. Coupled with the recent death of PM Bennett, the Unionist Government became too unstable and divided. After much bickering between the Tory-aligned Unionists and Liberal-aligned Unionists, many Liberal MPs have had enough and finally broke off; proceeding to join under Mackenzie King's Liberals. \n\n The dominance of the Red Tories is no more, it seems Canadian politics will return to the state of Liberal-Tory battling for supremacy... However a new opponent has taken the stage. \n\n Since the end of the Great War and continuation of the Unionist Government, many citizens were dissatisfied with the dominance of one party and a lack of real choice. With the founding of the CCF in 1930, many citizens were pleased to have a new, and more importantly, different party to vote for. They rapidly gain traction under Thomas Clement Douglas's charismatic leadership. "
canada.8.d:0 "With the split of the Unionist Coalition, the Tories have been put into the unfortunate circumstance of a minority government. As such, a Motion of No-Confidence was issued which successfully went through; taking down the Conservative government. Given that the Liberals just broke away from the Tories in a coalition and look to be unwilling to do so again, Diefenbaker only has one option on how to handle this."
canada.9.d:0 "Ever since we've been hit by the LSMC, we've suffered a dramatic surplus of resources. Very few nations can afford to subsidize imports from others, which leaves export-reliant nations in the gutter. We however have deduced two methods for handling our coal surpluses. We can export Coal to Britian at incredibly low costs for one. It would be much more beneficial for them, but we'd at least be profiting in some manner from it. Alternatively, we could sell it off domestically by lowering local prices."
canada.10.d:0 "The Canadians have offered to export coal at abnormally low prices. Following the aftermath of the LSMC, the Canadians have been unable to export many resources due to many nations not being able to afford old prices. Today, the Canadians have reviewed this and have looked to us for an Overlord-Colonial trade deal. We'd certainly benefit more than the Canadians would from this, however these prices would undercut local production. It might be a more popular to decline this offer."
canada.11.d:0 "The British seem to have accepted our offer for a Coal trade deal! This will surely help the two of our nations for the months to come!"
canada.12.d:0 "The British seem to have declined our offer for a Coal trade deal! They seem to feel that there is no need for any coal imports from us! Unfortunately, now we're in the exact same position as before. We've got stockpiles of resources, and nothing to do with them..."
canada.13.d:0 "The Federal Home Improvement Plan details that the government should Subsidize rates of interest on rehabilitation loans to nearly 75,000 homes. This will surely be a costly endeavour, and it might be more worth our time to do away with the idea entirely, but this would surely help revitalize our nation following the catastrophe of the London Stock Market Crash."
canada.14.d:0 "The Federal Home Improvement plan was successful! It has helped many Canadian citizens recover financially from the London Stock Market Crash, and many businesses have been sprouting up left and right! Thankfully, this has been a huge relief both on the government and people's shoulders. "
canada.15.d:0 "The Department of Munitions and Supply has allowed us to take much better stock of our military equipment. We have been able to reorganize supplies to a much greater degree and delegate equipment to military branches that could certainly use it better. Now, we have stockpiles of surplus equipment and we aren't quite sure what to do with them. Obviously, we could send them to Britain. The Royal Army has many more men, and is in need of many more rifles. Or, we could keep them here in Canada. We're the Spearhead of the Empire, we are surely deserving of our own equipment, are we not?"
canada.16.d:0 "The Canadians have taken an initiative to export military arms to us! We have taken stock of the shipment, it details as follows; \n\n 7,500 Lee-Enfield Rifles, 1,000 Artillery guns, 500 Vickers II Light Tanks and 500 Tonnes of Medical Equipment. \n\n We will make use of these arms and munitions, no doubt."
canada.17.d:0 "The Australians have rejected our offer for a Military Exchange. This doesn't necessarily hurt us, but this has turned out to be a massive waste of time."
canada.18.d:0 "Following the Great War, the Canadian Corps was widely considered to be one of the most competent and skilled branches of the Military Land forces of the British Empire. Whilst we kept the Canadian Corps intact, the Australians have reverted to use of Militias during the Interwar. Thankfully, the Australians have diverted a large portion of funding to their Naval sector. Conveniently, we could teach them a thing or two about land warfare whilst they could teach us some things concerning Naval expansion. It's been decided that we should send them an offer for an exchange of Military Personnel."
canada.19.d:0 "Following the Great War, the Canadian Corps was widely considered to be one of the most competent and skilled branches of the Military Land forces of the British Empire. Whilst they kept the Canadian Corps intact, we have re-adopted use of Militias during the Interwar. The Canadians, whilst keeping a Professional military structure, have badly neglected Naval development. We on the other hand have excelled in it. Today, the Canadians have proposed an offer of mutual benefit. They'd send Military Personnel to assist in Bringing the Royal Australian Army up to standards, and we'd send Shipbuilding experts to them to assist in Naval Modernization."
canada.20.d:0 "The Australians have accepted our Military Exchange! We're sending officers to Canberra and arranging transport for their shipbuilding Experts."
canada.21.d:0 "The Canadian East and West have been bickering for times immemorial. Be it disagreements in Parliament or grumbling in their own homes; it has existed since Confederation in 1867. Today, we must put aside these differences in face of War. Canadians from the Coast of Nova Scotia to the Shores of Vancouver must stand together, ready to face any obstacle that war may bring."
canada.22.d:0 "Our recent move of enacting conscription has not gone unnoticed by the Nation. The Quebecois have certainly been unhappy about it. \n\nSome have called strikes and protests against conscription, others have simply voiced disappointment with the Federal government for enacting conscription against their wishes. Nonetheless, if we don't back down; Quebec might find itself in a tangle soon." #Riots in Quebec
canada.23.d:0 "As we have been making efforts to expand the Turner Valley Oilfields, some topics have come up in Parliament. Particularly about our stance regarding regulation on the Oil Industry. Many of the Liberal-aligned Unionists have suggested keeping it unregulated and maintaining a Laissez-Faire approach to the situation. However, some of the more right-wing members of the Unionists have proposed regulating these Corporations more, and have further proposed establishing an Natural Gas Conservation Board (NGCB) to ensure responsible usage of our natural resources." #Gas regulations
canada.24.d:0 "As the London Stock Market Crash reduced the Canadian Economy to shambles, many Oil Companies found themselves attempting to cut costs at every corner. With them being reluctant to rent places to store the abundant amounts of Natural Gas that was extracted from Turner Valley and no regulations on it being conserved; they decided to simply get rid of it via Gas flaring. \n\nWhich, frankly, went terribly.\n\nNot only did Billions of dollars of natural gas become destroyed simply because there was no immediate market, but it also destroyed the Field's gas drive; which was responsible for the oil being produced in the first place. The Gas flares were visible from Calgary, over 50 miles away. Large amounts of public dissent coupled with political attacks on the Federal Government by the Albertan Provincial Government has badly crippled us to say the least.\n\nUnfortunately, Turner Valley is no longer the largest oilfield in the British Empire. Far from it. It has been reduced to nothing." #Gas flaring
canada.25.d:0 "The Wartime Industries Control Board (WICB) is an organization that will allow the Federal Government to have a less difficult time managing the various war industries of Canada. Whilst it certainly does cut down on the amount of administrative effort on our part, we are faced with the choice of exactly how much influence we exert over these industries. \n\nIt'd be a popular move to apply strong control over wages and pricing no doubt, however we could also take it a step further. By putting these industries directly under Federal control, we can more effectively meet our wartime needs. However, that'd be an unpopular move to say the least."
canada.26.d:0 "In the Great War, we were promised a voice. We were promised the freedom to make our own choices. We were promised a Commonwealth, in which every Dominion had a proper say in Foreign policy and were not forced to be subservient to London.\n\nHowever, it remains obvious as to whether or not those promises have been broken.\n\nBroken promises, dismissed notions, disregarded dissent. Those can describe what has happened to the Empire in recent years. The denial of the Statute of Westminster saw many of those promises become empty.\n\nNo matter. If no other Dominion is willing to lead the Diplomatic Battle against Britain, we will be the ones to do so. The question is; will we do this alone? Or will we rally the other Dominions to our side?"
canada.27.d:0 "Approximately 18 years ago, shortly after Henri Bourassa’s re-entry to Federal politics, the Bloc Nationaliste was assembled by Henri Bourassa during the Conscription Crisis of 1918. The Bloc Nationaliste was founded on the bases of Pan-Canadian Nationalism, Pacifism, Anti-Conscription, and most importantly; distance from the British. Later, it would be established across a Federal level, attracting support from opponents of Conscription and Anti-War Canadians. It would be branded as the Nationalist Bloc in English Canada. The party immediately began advocating a ‘Free, Equal, and United Canada’ with equal rights for both English and French Canadians on a Federal level.\n\nOf course, it also received incredibly large amounts of flak from English Canadians. Nonetheless, it grew steadily more popular as the war dragged on, however ended up fading into Federal irrelevance after the war.\n\nToday, Maurice Duplessis’ Union Nationale battles against the Liberals and Bloc Nationaliste on a provincial level. Fortunately, Duplessis’ charming and charismatic nature has allowed him to maintain a grip on power in Quebec, and the Bloc Nationaliste has found itself shut out of one of their only areas of support. \n\nFortunately for us, the Nationalist Bloc/Bloc Nationaliste will likely remain irrelevant for a foreseeable future. It’s unlikely they will pose any political significance within the coming years."
canada.28.d:0 "The prospect of another war was not received with enthusiasm by some citizens, and the Nationalist Bloc gave them an opportunity to find others who held similar sentiments. Recently, riots have erupted in various provinces across our nation, primarily protesting against the War. The most concerning part is that some of these riots, notably the non-violent ones, have been endorsed by the Nationalist Bloc. Nonetheless, these riots damage us. Vanadalism has been rampant in some areas, however we have them largely under control."
canada.29.d:0 "The recent rise in Nationalist traction has inhibited us in a few parliamentary areas, but perhaps the greatest concern is from the Nationalist supporters themselves. Various Arms producers have been suffering a series of sabotages. The individuals we've caught and arrested have been noted to possess loose connections to the Nationalists, however the Nationalist Bloc has denied any allegations that they are associated with the sabotage carried out by these individuals."
canada.30.d:0 "Unfortunately, the suspected Nationalists are growing bolder and bolder. They decided not to stop at sabotaging the war effort, but it seems they have begun to carry out bombing attacks on various notable Crown Corporations. It's is utterly unacceptable, however we can't find any solid evidence that traces these terrorists back to the Nationalist Bloc itself, we only have vague connections and suspicion.\n\nAs infuriating as it may be, there is little we can do at the moment with suspicion alone. The only thing we can do at the moment is provide these Crown Corporations with extra protection to safeguard them from any future bombing threats."
canada.31.d:0 "The Federal Elections have arrived once more. From Vancouver to Halifax, votes are pouring in; however which party garnered the most votes?"
canada.32.d:0 "The Federal Elections have arrived once more. From Vancouver to Halifax, votes are pouring in; however which party garnered the most votes?"
canada.33.d:0 "The Federal Elections have arrived once more. From Vancouver to Halifax, votes are pouring in; however which party garnered the most votes?"
canada.34.d:0 "Since the beginning of the Great War, the Canadian Military saw massive reforms undertaken. The creation of the Canadian Expeditionary Force and Canadian Corps during the Great War was seemingly a permanent act. Following the Great War, the various Military Land Forces of Canada were reorganized under Borden's Military Reorganization Act (passed alongside the National Defence Act), the last acts he passed before he died.\n\nToday, the organization of the R.C.A is as follows.\n\nThe RCA is split up into two branches, the Active RCA and Reserve RCA. Under the Active RCA, organizations such as the Canadian Corps and Canadian Expeditionary Force can be found. The Non-Permanent Active Militia is located under the Reserve RCA, although the Permanent Active Milita was disbanded in the Military Reorganization Act.\n\nNonetheless, despite that our Army is in a much better state than it was prior to the Great War, it will need some reforms in order to remain in peak condition. The question is; who should be the titular character in carrying these reforms out?"
canada.35.d:0 "The effects of the London Stock Market Crash continue to be felt widely throughout Canada. For this purpose, we created Work Relief Camps for men to provide the Government with labour, however, it is apparent that these Camps have had unforseen consequences.\n\nAwful pay, with equally bad working (and living) conditions has spurred men onto the streets of Vancouver to protest the conditions of said Relief Camps.\n\nPerhaps one of our largest concerns is the involvement of various  far-left organizations, who undoubtedly wish to use this situation to further their own agenda. The Workers' Unity League, alongside the Collectivist Party of Canada, seems to have some representatives present in the strikes.\n\nWe're faced with the option to cave to their demands and enter negotiations (to the delight of the radicals), or simply make empty promises and bury the matter. The latter isn't necessarily unsafe for our voter popularity, as the media has been relatively oblivious to the ordeal."
canada.36.d:0 "As we've agreed to enter negotiations concerning the Work Relief Camps, we'll have to choose which political organization we wish to organize the conferences. Each organization has different goals, the WUL intends to make conditions the most 'liveable', despite that it'd force us into deficit spending. The CPC intends to completely reform the work relief camps to become industrial in nature, and prioritize factory work for production of goods rather than for public works. Alternatively, we could work with the strikers themselves to undermine the WUL & CPC in this instance."
canada.37.d:0 "Three months ago, we promised the Workers in the Work Relief Camps that we'd investigate the living conditions of the Camps. They happily returns back to work under the premise that conditions would be improved.\n\nHowever, that was three months ago.\n\nIt quickly became evident that no change was coming, and that simply empty promises were made. Men have taken to the streets of Vancouver once more to protest against the conditions of the relief camps. Further exacerbated due to their frustration with the ruling Government for ignoring their grievances, the men are seemingly organizing themselves in order to commence a trek on-to Ottawa.\n\nThe self-titled 'Camp Crusade', partially inspired by the Jarrow March in Britain, has recently established their goal of bringing the matter to the Federal Government in Ottawa, and are seemingly willing to travel across the entire nation in an attempt to bring resolution to the matter. The mission of 1,500 men to travel upwards of 4,000km has garnered large portions of attention from local media, to say the least."
canada.38.d:0 "As the Crusaders arrived in Calgary, large amounts of noise have been created. Primarily celebrations from the Crusaders themselves for reaching their first checkpoint, however it's far from a pleasant situation for us.\n\nFor some god-unknown reason, the Crusaders saw fit to celebrate their first checkpoint ith a handful of drinks, and seem to have already intoxicated themselves. We've begun receiving reports of drunken crusaders entering brawls with local police forces. Whilst Constables remain tied up in an attempt to keep the situation from spiraling into mass violence, we're forced to re-inforce and bolster other departments in preparations for any further disputes between Crusaders and police forces."
canada.39.d:0 "As the Crusaders dismounted from their Boxcars to visit the city of Regina for a meal, Crusader representatives received word that Federal MPs had arrived to Regina in order to negotiate camp conditions.\n\nHowever what they didn't know, was that there would be no negotiations. In fact, there were multiple trucks concealing RCMP Squads.\n\nOnce the Crusaders were led into Market Square, Constable Millar blew a piercing whistle, and RCMP Squads armed with Batons, Revolvers and Tear Gas had charged and attacked the unsuspecting Crusaders from all sides. Crusaders were in panic and bewilderment until infuriation soon took over. Crusaders (and whichever unfortunate civilians which were also caught up in the ordeal) began to fight back using anything on hand, which included Rocks, Branches and Batons wrestled from Officers.\n\nThe Movement was broken up, quite literally. With over 200 Crusaders arrested, and the rest of them wounded in some manner, they were forced to disperse and return home to Vancouver."
canada.40.d:0 "The Crusaders have reached their second checkpoint, this time being Regina. Crusaders disembarked from their Boxcars and entered Regina for an evening meal, however they were surpised to be met by cheering and widespread support from the Citizens of Regina, some of which donated funds to the Crusade in order for them to reach Ottawa. Any hopes we had of the Crusaders running out of funds and abandoning their goals are now dashed."
canada.41.d:0 "The Crusaders have reached Winnipeg and dismounted to make a visit to the city. As the Crusaders stopped for a meal as-per-usual, it seems that a few individuals, particularly socialists with connections to the WUL, CPC & CMP have been attempting to agitate the Crusaders against our Government! Furthermore, they're attempting to publically undermine our support.\n\nActions such as these may not be tolerated, lest we wish to allow the situation to turn from benign to red."
canada.42.d:0 "Sudbury is the final checkpoint for the Crusaders before they reach Ottawa. Their visit to the city was much more lively this time, with citizens providing them with meals free of charge in anticipation of Parliament finally improving conditions in the Work Relief Camps."
canada.43.d:0 "The Crusaders have finally reached Ottawa and then marched to Parliament Hill. They wish to end their journey by having parliament to accept their request to legislate improvements for the Work Relief Camps.\n\nWhilst accepting this would likely be the best method of ending this journey on a good note, it'd also hurt our platform and prove to the nation that we are incapable of standing firm. What should we do?"
canada.44.d:0 "The current voting system in Canada is First-Past-The-Post, a system which is notorious for poor representation of fringe political organizations and non-mainstream political parties. However, we're faced with the matter of possibly reforming the voting system as-per our Party's platform."
canada.45.d:0 "The London Stock Market Crash has affected every single citizen in the Dominion, some more harshly than others. However, Saskatchewan is a province that was hard-hit by the LSMC following their collapse of Wheat Prices.\n\nFollowing the collapse of Wheat Prices, many men were forced to seek alternatives to Farming, and Coal Mining was a career that required little experience beforehand. It was the only viable choice for many men, and thus lead to massive expansion of Coal Mines in Saskatchewan, the Mineowners were now able to choose who they wanted to hire rather than accept any available labour.\n\nNevertheless, such benifits had come with mineowner attempts to cut corners with expenses. Wages were regularly slashed in order to stay in the green, and this has led to deplorable living conditions for the families of the miners and general labour-pool in Saskatchewan itself.\n\nThus, various socialist organizations such as the WUL & CPC have decided to agitate in this area. Recently they organized the Coal Miners and spurred them into a strike. As for whether or not it is successful remains to be seen."
canada.46.d:0 "Earlier today, at approximately 10:23AM, the Estevan Coal Miners have published their demands after tailoring a plan with the WUL and CPC. The plan outlines for the Mineowners to recognize the legitimacy of the Unions and increase their willingness to negotiate with them, a general increase in wages, more working hours for the Miners, and improved conditions within the mines.\n\nWe could attempt to mediate a negotiation between the Mineowners and the Miners, however that would likely result in strengthening the WUL & CPC, as they could easily argue that the only reason any change was made for the workers was due to their initiative in the situation. However, we're faced with another option on the other hand. As we've received a multitude of reports of vandalism from said frustrated Miners, we could easily deploy the RCMP to the area to break the strike up by force; effectively ending the issue and communicating that working with radical-left organizations will not result in any change or progress."
canada.47.d:0 "As we've taken the initiative to mediate these negotiations, we're going to have to be very careful with whice moves we make.\n\nThe situation remains very delicate, and outright siding with one party will definitely have repercussions, but also some long-term benifits."
canada.48.d:0 "Due to our choice in outright favouring the Miners over the Mineowners in the negotiations, the negotiation talks have broken down and resulted in the Mineowners declaring a regional lockout within Saskatchewan. It will likely be a few months until the Miners cave and give up the strike."
canada.49.d:0 "Due to our choice in outright favouring the Mineowners over the Miners in the negotiations, the negotiation talks have broken down and resulted in the Miners declaring a regional walkout within Saskatchewan. It will likely be a few months until the Mineowners cave and give in to the strike."
canada.50.d:0 "Frustration due to declining living standards and reluctance of the government to improve them in the poorer regions of Tornto has caused a few disorganized protests which ended up escalating into riots. The riots seem to be very apolitical in nature, and it seems that the WUL & CPC didn't have any success in turning these riots to their advantage, much to our fortune.\n\nNevertheless, the situation is volatile. And ending this riot with force could either end well for us, or incredibly poorly. Allowing the rioters to fizzle themselves out might be most prudent, after all, they have jobs too. And them refusing to work for too long will definitely cause them to go more hungry than they'd prefer. With that being said, it's obviously a viable option to wait the riots out as long as we're willing to suffer the property damages that would be incurred by such a move, or lack therof."
canada.51.d:0 "The Riots in Toronto have unfortunately escalated, reaching a point in which the unorganized mob is now simply vandalizing businesses on a whim. \n\nOur moves to contain the riots have been relatively fruitless to say the least, as our officers are often overwhelmed by the crowd and are incapable of properly halting any further escalation without usage of more force. In order to put down these riots, we're going to have to start issuing arrests and establish that we're more than willing to utilize force in instances such as this."
canada.52.d:0 "Fortunately, it seems the riots in Toronto have finally been broken up following a series of ruthless arrests, detainations, and violence on behalf of joint OPP & RCMP forces.\n\nWhilst the method that allowed us to reach this conclusion may have been far from preferable, it has at least allowed a resemblance of stability to return to the area."
canada.53.d:0 "Unfortunately, our choice to use force against the rioters has merely agitated them further, and has given way for political forces to hijack the riots. The Canadian Maximist Party under Tim Buck has condemned the elected Government for using violence against the people, and the Nationalist Bloc has also condemned the elected Government for being 'a body of imperialist lapdogs who will murder or injure Canadians without a second thought'. These political groups have also worked their way into leadership roles in the riots, which will unfortunately mean that the riots went from apolitical to extremely political.\n\nOn the bright side, this provides us with an opportunity to secretly arrest the new leadership of the riots, which will (hopefully) cause the riots to eventually fizzle out due to lack of leadership or common goal."

canelection.1.d:0 "Today is the day that the snap election begins. The would-be Unionist term has been cut short by a staggering 3 years with the collapse of the Unionists. Some citizens would argue the end of the Unionists was for the better, as it shifted the Conservatives strongly to the right and finally gave the left some traction to work with. Canadian Politics seem to have reverted to their natural state, with the Conservatives and Liberals battling it out for supremacy in the polls. \n\nHowever some new opponents have taken the stage. The CCF and Social Credit Party has rapidly grown during the period of Unionist dominance, strengthened by some disillusioned former supporters of the Liberal Party and Conservative party. \n\nAnd because of this, we stand in an interesting circumstance. The Election could easily go 4-ways, and the prospect of another Conservative Victory is unlikely to say the least."
canelection.2.d:0 "From the Mountains to the Coastal Cities of British Columbia, citizens are putting in their votes for this election. 16 Seats in Parliament are up-for-grabs, who will take a majority?" #BC
canelection.3.d:0 "The Citizens of the Imperial Oil basin are commiting votes for the election. Alberta is a strong base of the SoCreds, a Social Credit victory is anticipated. 17 Seats in Parliament are up-for-grabs here, will another party snatch them out of the hands of the SoCreds?" #AL
canelection.4.d:0 "In the farmland and wheatfields of the Prairies, the turnout is highly indecisive. A SoCred victory is plausible due to Saskatchewan's proximity to Alberta, however the CCF is also excerting some influence on the area. The Conservatives and Liberals continue to battle with eachother for control, who will be the ones to take the 21 seats?" #SK
canelection.5.d:0 "Citizens from across Manitoba are travelling to make their ways to the polls. With 17 seats available, all parties are attempting to further their position in parliament." #MB
canelection.6.d:0 "From the dense forests of Ontario to the dense urban region of Toronto, Ontarians find themselves questioning who they should vote for in the election. Ontario has been a strong base of support for the Unionists, and a Pro-Tory sentiment still strongly exists in the region. Ontario is a highly valuable province, as it has a grand total of 82 seats. It is without a doubt the most influential province in the Dominion."  #ON
canelection.7.d:0 "The most infamous province of the Dominion; Quebec. Housing a Francophone populace, they've historically opposed the Anglos at every turn. They are nonetheless the second-most populated Province, and have remained a base of support for the non-unionist Liberals during the Interwar. Quebec has 65 seats available for the four parties to seize. However the question remains though; who will be victorious? " #QB
canelection.8.d:0 "Yukon is a Territory located in Northern Canada, right above British Columbia. Rapidly settled by the British Empire to block American expansion of Alaska, it ended up becoming one of the more populated Territories. No clear party seems to have the edge here, however it's a situation of minimal interest; as there's only 1 seat available..." #YK

canelection.19.d:0 "Given the recent election of the CCF in the federal elections, Britain has firmly been convinced that allowing the CCF to spread socialism within our nation is a far too dangerous to be allowed. Due to this, they have sent a demand for Lord Tweedsmuir to temporarily dissolve Canadian parliament until a foreseeable future." #LONDON'S INTERVENTION
canelection.21.d:0 "Nearly 2 months ago, Parliament was dissolved by order of Britain in face of a radical socialist victory of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation. Since then, we've begun heavy reorganization. We've temporarily been governed by Lord Tweedsmuir and his selected cabinet of Loyalists, however, the Dissolution of Parliament was heavily assisted by the Military. In addition, a Military Government could be more effective than Tweedsmuir's absolutist regime, and London might not be opposed to the concept of the establishment of a Loyalist Junta."
