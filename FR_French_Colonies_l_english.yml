NFA_pacification_of_africa:0 "Pacification of West Africa"
NFA_pacification_of_africa_desc:0 "In order to make West Africa more 'accommodative' for the French, this colony has embarked on a mission of 'pacifying' the local populace. Regular military expeditions into the colonies to quell resistance, protection of trade personnel and entrepreneurs, and interning persons suspected of revolt have resulted in more stability and investor confidence for the colony, but has inversely hurt our relationship with the natives."

MOR_harsh_environment:0 "Harsh Environment"
MOR_harsh_environment_desc:0 "Generally hot, arid, and not suited for industrial expansion, investors refuse to assist colonial development of French North Africa. Our scientists seek to prove these investors wrong. By using flasks, beakers, and making shit up out of nowhere, they might be able to conjure up a 'study' that proves these investors incorrect. How long until it arrives is unknown though."

NFQ_colonial_unrest:0 "Native Unrest"
NFQ_colonial_unrest_desc:0 "Poor living conditions, lack of infrastructure and economic stagnation has caused Native Unrest to flare within our colony. Whilst our government actively works to correct these issues, it's undoubtedly going to be some time until the issue is resolved."
