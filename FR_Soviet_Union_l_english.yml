SOV_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "After their loss in the Great War, the Russian Empire fell into civil war and the collectivist Bolshevik party soon found itself as the ruler of Russia. That power was eventually disputed by anarchist sailors in Kronstadt, who rose up to fight authoritarianism in the nation. The uprising was a success and a majority of the old Bolsheviks resigned as a more democratic form of socialism was implemented- Libertarian Socialism, where the workers are truly in control. The beacon of socialism worldwide charges headfirst into an unknown future, threatened by Polish ambitions and even by revengeful old Bolsheviks..."

### FOCUSES ###

#Lenin
SOV_Premier_Lenin:0 "Premier Lenin"
SOV_Premier_Lenin_desc:0 "Lenin is currently the most powerful man in the Soviet Union. He was the leader of the October Revolution in 1917, which changed Russia forever. Lenin's plans, focused around large-scale civilian and military industry development was abruptly halted after an assassination attempt in late 1918, which caused him to massively redirect funds to the armament industry. This policy is unpopular in the party and the population. What will Lenin's answer be to this pressing question?"
SOV_help_agriculture:0 "Help the Agriculture"
SOV_help_agriculture_desc:0 "The Soviet Union, despite massive state efforts, is still largely unindustrialised, conserving the farming traditions of rural Russia. Obviously, this lack of industrialization and urbanization is not up to date with other countries in the world, and is lagging behind in the issue of mechanisation. Premier Lenin stresses the importance of improving the agriculture, not only for ensuring the peacetime food supply, but to ensure the Red Army is well-fed in case of war."
SOV_continue_industrilization:0 "Continue Industrialization"
SOV_continue_industrilization_desc:0 "The Soviet State has already accomplished much in the question of improving the industrial capacity of the country, but it's still not enough. The government will have to do further investments in the manufacturing sector, especially the armament sector, which is vital to the survival of our country."
SOV_workplace_democracy:0 "Support Workplace Democracy"
SOV_workplace_democracy_desc:0 "Almost all factories in our country have a council of workers' representation, better known as soviets. The soviets are vital to the working of the political and economical system of the Soviet Union: they negotiate better wages, discuss together how to improve the working situation, and are a big factor in involving normal working people with socialist politics. This importance encouraged Lenin to further support, fund and expand their authorizations."
SOV_new_land_reform:0 "New Land Reform"
SOV_new_land_reform_desc:0 "The heart of Russia still lies in its agriculture. A large part of our populace still works on the many fields of our country, and the October Revolution has actually barely changed this, with the old rural order of kulaks, rich and poor farmers still standing in many places. We have to expand opportunities for poor farmers to enlarge their properties, thus improving harvests and further securing that enough food will be available for the next years."
SOV_supress_reactionaries:0 "Suppress Reactionaries"
SOV_supress_reactionaries_desc:0 "Reactionary elements, disloyal to the revolution, are still very well alive and sabotaging the great socialist project of the Soviet Union, both inside and outside of our party. For a better future and the stability of our country, we need to root out those dangerous elements and finally stop them from preventing economical advances."
SOV_prepare_congress:0 "Prepare the XXVI Congress"
SOV_prepare_congress_desc:0 "The XXVI Congress of the CPSU will be organised in a few months. We need to prepare the halls, sleep places and accommodations, and send the thousands of invites to our most loyal party members all over the country, from the steppes of the Don to the barren wasteland of Siberia."
SOV_start_congress:0 "§YStart the XXVI Congress§!"
SOV_start_congress_desc:0 "The XXVI Congress of the CPSU will finally be opened, starting with an opening speech of Premier Lenin. After that, weeks of heated discussions, evaluations, declarations and speeches will begin, making it the ideal moment of deciding the economical and political course of the Soviet Union for the next year. Thousands of delegates are expected to arrive the next days, representing both the smallest rural villages and the biggest metropolises of the USSR."
SOV_kulak_question:0 "Kulak Question"
SOV_kulak_question_desc:0 "The congress members have raised a critical and important question involving the position of the kulaks. Many members of the congress view them as bourgeois elements in the socialist country, threatening reasonable agricultural improvement. Others, however, see this as fearmongering and state that the kulaks are too vital for the food production, thus saying that they produce to much to be punished. It remains to be seen what the congress will decide on this issue."
SOV_army_doctrine_question:0 "Army Question"
SOV_army_doctrine_question_desc:0 "A big issue involving the army was brought attention to during the congress: many congress members think the political influence of the CPSU is way to big for the army to function efficiently and independently, especially in the case of war. That's why some members think greater autonomy has to be given to the generals of the Red Army, while others say the political supervision over the army is vital to keep the army loyal to the revolution. What will the final decision be?"
SOV_foreign_policy:0 "Foreign Policy Question"
SOV_foreign_policy_desc:0 "The Soviet Union's foreign policy was focussed from the beginning on exporting the revolution abroad, with Lenin hoping that the red wave would flood all of Europe. Unfortunately, that didn't happen, and many party members think that the money spent on foreign operations can be used more efficiently to improve the national economy. This will prove to the western peoples that our model is superior, and they will start the revolution themselves, according to many party members."
SOV_minorities:0 "Minority Question"
SOV_minorities_desc:0 "The Soviet Union is a diverse country, containing hundreds of unique ethnic groups, each with their own tradition and culture. Under Premier Lenin, the minorities, violently oppressed during the czarist regime, got some very important rights. Is it for the good of the country to further expand these rights, or is the current system satisfactory? Most minority delegates say the former, while many Russian party members think the latter."
SOV_secret_service:0 "Secret Service Question"
SOV_secret_service_desc:0 "The secret service of the USSR, the OGPU, has a lot of work to do: eradicate reactionary elements in the country and securing the interests of the revolution, which gave them many authorities. Many party members want to reduce the powers of the OGPU, arguing that the biggest threats are already eradicated, and that the excessive actions of the secret service undermine the credibility of the socialist system. Many disagree however, and still see many threats..."
SOV_resignation:0 "Resignation?"
SOV_resignation_desc:0 "Since the beginning of the XXVI Congress of the CPSU, rumours arose about the general state of Premier Lenin, with his health clearly deteriorated since last congress, and his problems becoming clear during the opening speech, when he coughed multiple times and showed signs of breathing problems. So the question for many is: will premier Lenin step back after 19 years of rule?"
SOV_congress_over:0 "The Congress is over"
SOV_congress_over_desc:0 "The last congress halls closed their doors, the last trains with congress delegates left today. The XXVI Congress is concluded, many things have been discussed, many things have been voted on, and the course of the soviet state is set - for now..."
#Kirov
SOV_Premier_Kirov:0 "Premier Kirov"
SOV_Premier_Kirov_desc:0 "As a consequence of the release of Lenin's testament and the subsequent party elections, Sergey Kirov has become the new leader of the Soviet Union. He aims to continue Lenin's policies and improve the education of workers, support voluntary collectivization and strengthen workplace democracy."
SOV_support_from_the_poor:0 "Regain Support from the Workers"
SOV_support_from_the_poor_desc:0 "Because of Lenin's irrational focus on the armaments industry, he largely neglected the civilian industry. This caused a great number of workers to be dissapointed in the CPSU and to distance themselves from Leninism. Premier Kirov will try to change this by recalibrating the industry and by focussing more on the needs of the workers."
SOV_gain_support_vanguardist:0 "Gain Support from the National Collectivists"
SOV_gain_support_vanguardist_desc:0 "The only way Premier Kirov was able to come to power, was by the art of compromising. To further ensure inner-party support, he will need to convince the National Collectivist faction to support him..."
SOV_support_from_the_libertarians:0 "Gain Support from the Libertarians"
SOV_support_from_the_libertarians_desc:0 "Premier Kirov needs to compromise with the Libertarian faction of the party to ensure support for his policies. Negotiations with them will start soon!"
SOV_support_peasents:0 "Gain Support from the Peasants"
SOV_support_peasents_desc:0 "Support of the peasant class, which forms a large part of our population is essential in order to secure our power and influence on the countryside. By paying more attention to the needs of the farmers and by listening to their concerns, we may be able to garner more support from them."
SOV_gain_support_soldiers:0 "Gain the Support of Soldiers"
SOV_gain_support_soldiers_desc:0 "The Red Army is one of the biggest in the world and played a major role in securing the interests of the October Revolution. Without them, none of this would have been possible. After the turmoil following Lenin's death, it's very important to secure military support."
SOV_status_quo_upheld:0 "Status Quo Upheld"
SOV_status_quo_upheld_desc:0 "Premier Kirov is the embodiement of the Leninist status quo, a symbol of stability and serenity. This is comforting for many citizens of our country in these very strange and busy times, thus we can use this image in the positive portrayal of our party."
SOV_enlighten_workers:0 "Enlighten the Workers"
SOV_enlighten_workers_desc:0 "Just like Lenin, Premier Kirov desires to expand the general knowledge of the workers by promoting newspapers, cheap (informative) books and adult education opportunities. Every man and woman needs to have the possibility to unfold him or herself. It is the foundation of our socialist state."
SOV_strengthen_workplace_democracy:0 "Strengthen Workplace Democracy"
SOV_strengthen_workplace_democracy_desc:0 "Premier Kirov wants to continue Lenin's policy of expanded workers' democracy by expanding the rights of the soviets, further promoting and funding them. This will increase the political involvement of the general populace, which will be only for the better of our country."
SOV_ban_factions:0 "Ban Factions"
SOV_ban_factions_desc:0 "Premier Kirov, being the great compromiser he is, managed to convince the National Collectivist and Libertarian factions of the party to finally stand behind one person, himself. This basically means factionalism is no longer needed, and that everyone can reason on their own which policy is best and worst."
SOV_land_reform:0 "Start a Land Reform"
SOV_land_reform_desc:0 "A large portion of land is still barely cultivated in our country, following the confiscation of landlords' property and a general lack of mechanisation in agriculture. It's very important to ensure agriculture will be more mechanised and that more land will be cultivated!"
SOV_voluntary_collectivization:0 "Support Voluntary Collectivization"
SOV_voluntary_collectivization_desc:0 "In the Soviet Union, approximately 1% of the cultivated land is collectivized. This is not a lot, but we can improve this by encouraging more people - both materially and financially - to enter collective farms or to found new ones."
SOV_strengthen_OGPU:0 "Strengthening the OGPU"
SOV_strengthen_OGPU_desc:0 "The OGPU, our secret service, is the shield and sword of the revolution, its greatest protector. It's of the highest significance to ensure the proper working of this organization and to not infringe their rights.

SOV_control_workers:0 "Control Labour"
SOV_control_workers_desc:0 "Lenin's policy of workers' management certainly had good intentions, but didn't turn out too well. The workers' councils were barely supervised, so many of them became hotspots of reactionarism and dangerous ideas, and helped nothing in improving the production efficiency of the factories they represented. We need to supervise the soviets more, so that we will be able to steer them in the right political direction."

SOV_purge_opposition:0 "Kill the Opposition"

SOV_end_freedom_movement:0 "End Freedom of Movement"
SOV_end_freedom_movement_desc:0 "Allowing our citizens freedom of movement is a ridiculous practice, which greatly hurts the Union. What if they plan to sabotage industrial equipment? What if they plan to steal the harvest of a farm? What if they are foreign spies? We can't allow this! Thus, we should set up an internal travel system which controls and restricts movement between cities, making it easier to contain enemies of the state."
SOV_control_children:0 "Control the Education of Children"
SOV_control_children_desc:0 "To make sure the next generation of students is loyal to the ideas of our great leader, we need to make sure they learn to appreciate our political system and Premier Yezhov. As such, we will enact policies that make it so from a young age, children are only allowed to read books about Yezhov and the party, sing songs about Yezhov and the party and write about Yezhov and the party! A child's love for Yezhov should be greater than any other love!"
SOV_state_atheism:0 "State Atheism"
SOV_state_atheism_desc:0 "God is dead. Irrelevant. Anti-social. Religion is the opium of the masses and has a terrible influence on many people all over our country.

If Comrade Lenin was the brain of the revolution, then the armed forces are its hands and feet! Without the Red Army, the Red State would be nothing!

SOV_install_pro_tukhachevsky_desc:0 "The first step Tukhachevsky will take will be to reorganize and remanage the bureaucracy, working thus to place friends in high places and stripping all semblance of power from those that opposed him.

SOV_repression:0 "Suppressing the Opposition"
SOV_repression_desc:0 "Comrade Tukhachevsky is no tyrant but there are limits to the freedom that criticism may be directed onto him, lest they harm the integrity and unity of the Soviet Union itself.

SOV_give_economy_to_trade_unions_desc:0 "As promised by Tukhachevsky, the Soviet Union will be undergo a societal and political reform that gives greater powers and rights to the trade unions that so powerfully supported his premiership.

SOV_price_controls:0 "Price Controls"
SOV_price_controls_desc:0 "The soviets have had to much of a say thus far in the control of the economy and this has very much hampered our civilian industry.

SOV_agriculture:0 "Help the Agriculture"

SOV_equal_rights_female_desc:0 "Both women and men can be members of the proletariat, and thus women should be also given representation and political rights in a proper dictatorship of the proletariat similar to that of men.

SOV_trade_union_economy_desc:0 "The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions is the collective organization through which trade unions express themselves. Seeing how socialism can only function in a state led by workers, not only should the VTsSPS regain its independence, it should also be given much greater control over the economy, as only then can the economy be shaped according to the desires and intentions of the workers! The diktats should end and participatory management should begin."
SOV_heavy_industry_investments:0 "Heavy Industry Investments"
SOV_heavy_industry_investments_desc:0 "New heavy industry investments will begin under a cooperative effort of trade unions and the state rather than simply an effort of the soviets and the state. Expectations are that this should result in much greater industrial and economical output."

SOV_freedom_of_speech_in_the_party_desc:0 "The doors of the party should be opened to new members and new voices should be heard that promote possibly alternative interpretations of Leninist socialism, regardless if those contradict pre-established ideas. After all, it's not like this level of freedom of speech contradicts democratic centralism or anything like that and we surely can assure that Leninism is still upheld somehow with new dissidenting opinions in the RKP."
SOV_exclude_peasent_from_power:0 "No Power for Peasants"
SOV_exclude_peasent_from_power_desc:0 "The peasantry are not a proper member of the proletarian class and thus have no place in the administration of a true proletarian government.

SOV_Syndicalist_State:0 "A Syndicalist State"
SOV_Syndicalist_State_desc:0 "Shliapnikov once portrayed himself as a Leninist, albeit one that supported greater worker representation. Now, as his reforms draw to a close and the trade unions have finally affirmed control over the USSR, the curtain draws to a close on his façade and it becomes ever more clear that this administration of his has essentially deconstructed Leninism and established a syndicalist state, run by syndicates.

soviet.1.d:0 "The land of the Russians was at one point the world’s third largest empire, spanning three continents. Although a military powerhouse, the largely rural and deindustrialized Russian Empire lagged heavily behind its European neighbors. In 1914, after the Archduke of Austria was shot by a Serbian in Sarajevo, Russia mobilized to defend it’s Serbian ally against the invading Austrian army. Thus begun the Great War between the Russians, the British, and the French against the Germans, the Austrians, and the Ottomans.\nThe Great War was a war unlike any other. As Central Powers forces pushed east, morale lowered and unrest grew until the melting point where most of Russia was in arms against the monarchy in the 1917, beginning the February Revolution. The Tsar eventually abdicated his power to the revolutionaries, who were an unstable pact between the Petrograd Soviet lead by the collectivist Bolsheviks and the Provisional Government led by republicans. Street fighting and an advancing German Army led to the pact being broken and Civil War broke out to decide the fate of Russia– the collectivist Bolsheviks, led by revolutionary Vladimir Lenin, or the big tent anti-Bolshevik White Movement.\n\nBy March 1918, the Bolsheviks controlled most of the Russian population and had pushed the Whites back to Siberia. However, the Bolsheviks were now fighting the advancing German army. Lenin would sign the treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Central Powers, removing Russia from the war in exchange of ceding the Baltic States, Belarus, Ukraine, and Poland to the Central Powers. In late 1918, Lenin barely missed an assassination attempt by a Left SR member. This caused him to panic and make peace deals with Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia and the other states in the Baltic and Caucasus region, as well as making de facto peace with the Whites in the Far East. Because of Lenin’s fear behind a western attack he started expanding the armament industry ignoring the issue of the lacking industrialization and the technological backwardness of the nation.\n\nSince then, the Bolsheviks have begun fracturing. Lenin’s right hand man, Leon Trotsky, has begun formulating his own revision of Leninism that fought for proletarian internationalism, mass democracy, and most important of all, permanent revolution. This theory was called “Internationalism”. Meanwhile, a high ranking Bolshevik named Vyacheslav Molotov would develop a radically different ideology known as National Collectivism, believing that the Soviet Union must be strengthened internally and all traitors must be purged. A past comrade of Lenin, Nikolai Bukharin, has become disenfranchised with Lenin’s policies and has started to advocate for an ideology that allows workers control of their workplaces as well as the liberalization of the Soviet government. A small amount of socialists remain loyal to Leninism such as Sergey Kirov and there are even whispers of a military coup…But Lenin has great plans for the future, but his health is degrading.."
soviet.2.d:0 "Vladimir Lenin has passed away! This is a disaster as without Lenin the many internal factions of the communist party will now scramble for power. Even worse, many groups opposing Lenin are showing their desire to start a protest and some seem to even have the ambition of overthrowing the government. While all this is happening though, many people are mourning for Lenin and hoping that they will weather the storm safely that will follow his death. The people hope that while Lenin has died, his cause lives on!"
soviet.3.d:0 "The Soviet Union has had no real leader since Lenin's death and this has caused the situation to escalate dramatically. Because of this there have been whispers of dissent and coups, with meeting between important generals making the people worry that they are planning a military coup. Sergey Kirov also has got the chance of becoming the new premier, but the workers might oppose him, because of his strong following of Lenin's idea which most workers oppose. Then there are Bukharin, Molotov and Zinoviev who have formed an alliance binded together by their opposition to Trotsky."
soviet.4.d:0 "In order to prevent the USSR from falling into the hands of conspirators, revisionists or the military, Molotov, Bukharin and Zinoviev have formed an emergency troika and taken over. This should hopefully bring an air of stability into this destabilized Union."
soviet.5.d:0 "With an apparent urgency, Molotov has decided to issue unilateral orders for the immediate exile of a number of 'anti-Soviet' reactionaries, revisionists and radicals who opposed him. The action is only a symptom of the recent radical actions committed by Molotov in what appears to be an attempt at the consolidation of his authority. Both Bukharin and Zinoviev have reportedly began to become wary of Molotov's ideals and now prepare for the worse."
soviet.6.d:0 "It seems that with Molotov acting ever more independently, Bukharin has travelled to Oslo to a reunion of like-minded left communists. In this peculiar meeting, a manifesto was issued for the reduction of the Soviet bureaucracy and the strengthening of democracy, aiming thus at a libertarianist overhaul in the country. While Bukharin's name itself is not listed in the manifesto, his presence in the meeting has raised some doubts in the USSR regarding the unity of the troika."
soviet.7.d:0 "During a private meeting of the troika, Molotov has proposed for the Union to adopt his ideological formulations, the so-called ideals of National Collectivism, as state policy. This interpretation of Marxism surrounds the idea of socialism in a state and many see it as contrary to some of Lenin's own beliefs. Indeed, Zinoviev and Bukharin strongly opposed any attempts at implementing it and called it nonsensical."
soviet.8.d:0 "In a rally behind closed doors, Trotsky has once more brought forth his idea of "internationalism". This concept, which envisions a Soviet Union that is built and functions around the idea of constant worldwide revolution and advocates for the endless export of socialism abroad, is seen a serious delusion and has already been widely denounced by Lenin, however, considering how Internationalism has proven successful in the Congress of Soviets, some see him as a potential political tool that may be used for furthening their authority."
soviet.9.d:0 "After meetings abroad and in the Union, Bukharin has formed his own faction of libertarianists. They have republished their original manifesto, including the citation of their aims surrounding the desire to democratize the Soviet Union and end the bureaucratization of the economy, but only this time with Bukharin's name in it. Many feel like Bukharin's group has ideas which are harmful to the Union and both Zinoviev and Molotov have started voicing such concerns at Bukharin's strong manifestations very clearly."
soviet.10.d:0 "With both Bukharin and Molotov creating bases of support and consolidating popularity, in a sudden and controversial turn of events, Zinoviev and Trotsky have joined hands and formed a united front. Both Bukharin and Molotov have called out Zinoviev for this and a great part of Zinoviev's supporters appear to be hesitant to continue siding with him, but what is done is done. This new pact has allowed Trotsky to leave his political isolation and he now enters the forefront of the power relations in the Union, bringing with him a large group of party members."
soviet.15.d:0 "It appears that as Zinoviev and Trotsky deepen their alliance, Zinoviev falls ever deeper into Trotsky's hands and becomes ever more dependent on him. Should this situation not be fixed, soon enough Zinoviev might find himself at the mercy of Trotsky and unable to wrestle power away from him."
soviet.23.d:0 "After increasing tensions and disputes and the formation of distinct coalitions, a power struggle has broken out in the troika and Molotov, Bukharin and Zinoviev are now at each other's throats. While officially they still remain allies, a large and heated discussion regarding the future of the Soviet Union and their different visions of socialism have apparently rendered any collaboration essentially dead. Now, Molotov and his National Collectivists, Bukharin and his Libertarians and the Zinoviev-Trotsky front all gear their discourse and rhetoric to prepare for an all-out political battle."
soviet.24.d:0 "Our anti-corruption programms have thus far been a success. We have been able to eradicate corruption in the Congress of Soviets and all other departments of government. Hopefully this will prevent corruption rising again."
soviet.25.d:0 "Corruption has been rising. We have been unable to suppress the rise of it. We should start an anti-corruption campaign in order to eradicate this problem."
soviet.26.d:0 "Corruption has become a normal occurance in the government. This is hurting our image tremendously."
soviet.27.d:0 "Corruption has become omnipresent. We should act fast if we want to save the image of our regime."
soviet.28.d:0 "Corruption has been an issue a while, but seems to have somewhat diminished recently. Corrupt officials have been arrested and examples have been made. We are a long way from a corruption-free government, but we are improving things."
soviet.29.d:0 "Thanks to our renewed efforts, Corruption is becoming a rarer practice by every passing day. We have even heard of bribes being refused! Maybe are officials are learning morals, or are learning to fear. Either way, corruption is steadily declining."
soviet.30.d:0 "Corruption has become an issue of the past. Not only are bribes being refused, they are not even being proposed. This is not only helping our industry and bureaucracy run smoother, but is also improving our reputation on the world stage."
troika.1.d:0 "Molotov has been critical of our rise to power for quite a while now. As we prepare our political campaign through the Soviet Union, Molotov has coordinated with his political allies to block our visits to multiple Soviet councils across the union, hampering our efforts to find local support. He is clearly only interested in holding not just the Soviet government back but the Soviet citizens as well."
troika.2.d:0 "Trotsky's speech to the Soviet congress had seemingly gone well but before delegates could even respond, our supposed allies in the Troika, Molotov and Bukharin presented their own speech in which they both accused Trotsky of being a corrupt reactionary, who uses his own political position for personal gains. After the tirade was over the congress fell silent, deputies shocked at the weight of the accusations."
troika.3.d:0 "Bukharin's speech to the Soviet congress had seemingly gone well but before delegates could even respond, our supposed allies in the Troika, Molotov and Zinoviev presented their own speech in which they both accused Bukharin of being a corrupt reactionary, who uses his own political position for personal gains.

troika.4.d:0 "Molotov's speech to the Soviet congress had seemingly gone well but before delegates could even respond, our supposed allies in the Troika, Bukharin and Zinoviev presented their own speech in which they both accused Molotov of being a corrupt reactionary, who uses his own political position for personal gains. After the tirade was over the congress fell silent, deputies shocked at the weight of the accusations."
troika.5.d:0 "Recently we have appointed several key allies to the position of officer within the Soviet Armed Forces. While this was completely in our legal right to appoint whoever we see fit, Zinoviev and Trotsky have used their ties to higher ups within the military to overrule our decision."
troika.6.d:0 "Recently we have accused several members of the Soviet Congress of being reactionary dissidents who only seek to undermine the Revolution. While this move was popular with most in the congress, our former ally Bukharin has overruled our executive decision citing lack of evidence. While we could drop the issue, our supporters have suggested we open an investigation to determine the validity of our claims."
troika.7.d:0 "Recently we have accused several members of the Soviet Congress of being reactionary dissidents who only seek to undermine the Revolution. While this move was popular with most in the congress, our former ally Zinoviev has overruled our executive decision citing lack of evidence. While we could drop the issue, our supporters have suggested we open an investigation to determine the validity of our claims."
troika.8.d:0 "Our investigation of several delegates of the Soviet Congress has found them innocent of any covert activities against our nation. This revelation has only served to undermine our legitimacy to the congress and bolster our opponents."
troika.9.d:0 "Our investigation of several delegates of the Soviet Congress has found them guilty of committing covert activities against our nation and government. These men are to be expelled from congress immediately and arrested to face a final sentencing. This investigation has shown our dedication to the security and justice of the Soviet Union."
troika.10.d:0 "Rumors of bribery have been floating around the Soviet Congress for a while now but now it seems now that the Congress is bold enough to directly accuse us of of such unethical actions. Despite denying all charges, the Congress still hold us accused. Our allies in the Troika refuse to deny the charges but have otherwise not commented on the controversy."
troika.11.d:0 "Corruption within the Soviet government has become an open secret. Many politicians use state resources for their own personal gain. In an attempt to save face, our former allies Molotov and Bukharin have put most of the blame for rising corruption on solely Grigory Zinoviev. They compare him to a dictator and denounce him as a traitor of the working class."
troika.12.d:0 "Corruption within the Soviet government has become an open secret. Many politicians use state resources for their own personal gain. In an attempt to save face, our former allies Molotov and Zinoviev have put most of the blame for rising corruption on solely Nikolai Bukharin. They compare him to a dictator and denounce him as a traitor of the working class."
troika.13.d:0 "Corruption within the Soviet government has become an open secret. Many politicians use state resources for their own personal gain. In an attempt to save face, our former allies Bukharin and Zinoviev have put most of the blame for rising corruption on solely Vyacheslav Molotov. They compare him to a dictator and denounce him as a traitor of the working class."
troika.15.d:0 "While we have been serving the Soviet Union, our Troika allies Molotov and Bukharin are rumored to be in secret talks with higher ups in the Soviet military. They claim this is solely official business concerning national security but as tensions within the Troika mount and ambitious men buttheads, fears of a possible military coup are mounting. We must work to increase our influence in the military and undermine our opponents"
troika.16.d:0 "While we have been serving the Soviet Union, our Troika allies Molotov and Trotsky are rumored to be in secret talks with higher ups in the Soviet military. They claim this is solely official business concerning national security but as tensions within the Troika mount and ambitious men buttheads, fears of a possible military coup are mounting. We must work to increase our influence in the military and undermine our opponents"
troika.17.d:0 "While we have been serving the Soviet Union, our Troika allies Bukharin and Trotsky are rumored to be in secret talks with higher ups in the Soviet military. They claim this is solely official business concerning national security but as tensions within the Troika mount and ambitious men buttheads, fears of a possible military coup are mounting. We must work to increase our influence in the military and undermine our opponents"
troika.19.d:0 "After much debate within the Congress, a majority of delegates voted to inaugurate Vyacheslav Molotov as sole Chairmen of the Soviet Union and in effect terminating the Troika that has been in effect for several months. Bukharin and Trotsky were publicly seen congratulating Molotov but are rumored to have voted against his promotion."
troika.20.d:0 "After much debate within the Congress, a majority of delegates voted to inaugurate Nikolai Bukharin as sole Chairmen of the Soviet Union and in effect terminating the Troika that has been in effect for several months. Molotov and Trotsky were publicly seen congratulating Bukharin but are rumored to have voted against his promotion."
troika.21.d:0 "The rug has been pulled! It appears that while Grigory Zinoviev attempted to deal with the power struggle against Bukharin and Molotov, he relied too heavily on Trotsky and his platform, and despite Zinoviev's successes, the one who most profited out of all of it was Trotsky! Thus, it was hardly a surprise to anyone but Zinoviev when delegates voted to inaugurate Leon Trotsky as sole Chairmen of the Soviet Union, effectively terminating the Troika that has been in effect for several months. Trotsky's election saw Zinoviev too shocked and tied up in Trotsky's web to do anything but congratulate him. Meanwhile, both Bukharin and Molotov have remained silent on the issue."
troika.22.d:0 "Our effort to gain the support of the Soviet military has hit a major roadblock. Despite our arguments that the military desperately needs more funding, Congress has still vetoed any resolution to increase funding citing budgetary issues."
troika.23.d:0 "Heeding our warnings that the Soviet military were inadequately funded to protect our nation, Congress has agreed to increase military funding. This will surely show to Soviet officers that we are dedicated in supporting their position."
troika.24.d:0 "After our speech the Soviet Congress exploded into applause. Throughout the chamber delegates commended our promises to the further development and growth of the Soviet economy, as well as our dedication to support Socialist movements across the globe."
troika.25.d:0 "After hearing multiple testimonies today the Congress of the Soviet Union has voted to expel Molotov from all government duties. While some feared the possibility of Molotov leveraging his supporters in the military to pressure congress against this ruling the military has stayed loyal to the Congress."
troika.26.d:0 "After hearing multiple testimonies today the Congress of the Soviet Union has voted to expel Bukharin from all government duties. While some feared the possibility of Bukharin leveraging his supporters in the military to pressure congress against this ruling the military has stayed loyal to the Congress."
troika.27.d:0 "After hearing multiple testimonies today the Congress of the Soviet Union has voted to expel Zinoviev and Trotsky from all government duties. While some feared the possibility of Trotsky leveraging his supporters in the military to pressure congress against this ruling the military has stayed loyal to the Congress."
troika.37.d:0 "Conflicting goals between Troika members has resulted in the stagnation of the Soviet Union. Suspicions of corruption and collusion with the military have lead the Russian Senate to a vote of no confidence against the Troika. In this interim an ambitious general has used his influence to form an emergency government. Commander Mikhail Tukhachevsky despite being a controversial figure and a hostile critic of the Troika has promised to bring stability and prosperity to the Soviet Union and lead the working class towards total and complete economic liberation from capitalism and bourgeois liberalism."
soviet.31.d:0 "Soviets have sent 2000 guns in order to help in the struggle to liberate Iberia!"

sovietpol.0.d:0 "The imperialists have declared war on us! Women and men! Grab your guns, your hoes and your wrenches and start working for the glory of the motherland and the triumphant victory of the revolution!"
sovietpol.1.d:0 "Our efforts of building up light and heavy industry have thus far been successful. Every week, a new enterprise increases its output. While we still are far away from our goals, we have so far laid very important groundwork for their eventual completion."
sovietpol.2.d:0 "With our industry expanding rentlessly we are in desperate need of every worker we can find. Therefore, a proposal has arisen to bring the Muzhik (peasants) to the cities so they can help us expand our industry. However, this would also destabilize the already fragile food supply even more."
sovietpol.3.d:0 "Our decision to use workers from the land may have given us the needed manpower to fulfill our goals but it did cause a food shortage that has hurt our relations with local peasantry."
sovietpol.4.d:0 "Our decision to not use the workforce of the Muzhik resulted us in failing to reach our goals. At the same time, we also avoided a possible food shortage that might have been caused by relying on the muzhik, so not all his terrible."
sovietpol.5.d:0 "Since the Union is behind most western nation technologically, as there is a lack of skilled labour, we have begun investing into the eduction of new engineers, specialists and scientist. This should hopefully greatly propel our nation forward."
sovietpol.6.d:0 "A new governmental policy has begun where exemplary industrial workers will be awarded a special rank of honour called the "Shock Worker of the Socialist Labour". This gives them a badge, certificate and a financial initiatve, all of which should hopefully lead to greater labour discipline and improvement of morale."
sovietpol.7.d:0 "The White Sea-Baltic Canal has recently finished construction. It connects the White Sea to the Baltic Sea, utilizing both the Neva and Svir River and should hopefully improve our naval commerce and help Belomorsk becoming a major city in the region."
sovietpol.8.d:0 "The recent rise in our national industrial output and the increase in the manufacturing of machinery, machine tools, turbines and tractors is very impressive. ALthough most of this industry is mostly located in the Urals, Kuzbass, Leningrad and Moscow, it also has begun expanding into Kazakhstan and other underdeveloped regions in our Union, greatly helping them in their economical development."
sovietpol.9.d:0 "The first modern factories are being created in the country that have output, efficiency and quality comparable to private Western ones. While there are not many of them yet it lays the groundwork for the creation of a modern industry. Truly a hallmark in showing the success of socialism!"

sovietpol.20.d:0 "Recently, the PGOTZ, a farm tractor produced in the tank factories of Perm and Gorki, has begun being used in mass scale in the Union. Although, it is loosely based on the American International 15/30 build and we never got the license to build it, theft is not theft if it infringed on the capitalists who they themselves steal from their workers. Sometimes these kinds of actions are necessary to ensure the future of socialism."
sovietpol.25.d:0 "The need to strengthen the state means that we must also take care in reforming the teaching and rules of school and education. Thus, we shall now begin the implementation of a tution system for the final three forms of secondary education and we will also implement a mandatory school uniform, including, of course, mandatory pigtails for girls."
sovietpol.26.d:0 "Our beloved leader has steadily begun forming a successful cult of personality around himself, being (rightly) called out in all forms of national propaganda for his bold and wise personality and his popularity amongst the people. His pictures are now omnipresent across the nation and he is seen by many people as their grand protector."

sovietpol.100.d:0 "Our decision to go to war while having large issues with our food logistics and supply has caused a major famine. This has extensively hurt our country's stability and severely damaged our reputation with the Soviet peasantry."
sovietpol.101.d:0 "Our decision to go to war while having large issues with our food logistics and supply has caused a small famine. This has hurt our country's stability and damaged our reputation with the local peasantry."
sovietpol.102.d:0 "Our decision to go to war while having large issues with our food logistics and supply has caused a minor food shortage across the country. This has slightly hurt our country's stability."

sovietpol.1000.d:0 "Today twenty-two RKP members of working class origins appealed in writing to Kirov to help heal the rift they thought had emerged between workers and party leaders in Russia. Among their complaints, they cited that bourgeois elements had flooded into the party, diluting the influence of proletarian initiatives and increasing dissidence among socialists. They protested the suppression of participatory democracy within trade unions and the trend toward unilateral decision-making by the party and trade union bureaucracy. All of them being former metalworkers associated with the All-Russian Union of Metalworkers, and having a long history of advocating worker activism within the Bolshevik party have made this appeal quite popular amongst other political and social figures."
sovietpol.1001.d:0 "With Kirov denying the appeal of the twenty-two, the opposition have seen themselves forced to form their own faction in order to combat Kirov and his allies. They now call for the debureaucratization of the economy and support the increasement of democracy and other Syndicalist policies. If they will be successful is uncertain..."
sovietpol.1003.d:0 "The All-Russian Union of Writers led by Evgeny Zamyatin have officially declared their support for Shliapnikov. Among their key reasons to do so, was allegedly their desire to keep politics out of fiction. This is in sharp contrast to the All-Russian Association of Proletarian Writers which propagated the hegemony of working-class values in fiction and also support Kirov as successor to Lenin."
sovietpol.1004.d:0 "Nearly all trade unions have supported Shliapnikov in his bid to become premier of the Soviet Union. This was quite predictable considering Shliapnikov's support from the worker-socialists and his promise of turning control of the economy over to the trade unions but regardless still serves to hurt Kirov's bid for power."
sovietpol.1005.d:0 "The Worker's Opposition decided to start a tour through the Soviet Union meeting with delegates and workers across the nation. They hope this way they can increase their support in the population and persuade some delegates to vote for them."
sovietpol.1006.d:0 "Shliapnikov started his tour by visiting many factories to ensure that the workers will support him in his bid to become premier and put pressure on the delegates to vote for him. His next destiny is speaking to the delegates to hopefully get their support."
sovietpol.1007.d:0 "Shliapnikov is holding speeches before many delegates trying to convince them that what he supports is not syndicalism but an alternative communist interpretation. He already has got the backing of a large minority of delegates but if Kirov does not do act soon, he may lose the support of even more delegates."
sovietpol.1008.d:0 "Shliapnikov's tour has ended. It has been a major success with him increasing his support in the population and drawing a lot of delegates on his side."
sovietpol.1049.d:0 "Kollontai today attempted to hold a speech before local leaders but we took her off the list of orators. This should hopefully help us in the fight against the Worker's Opposition."
sovietpol.1050.d:0 "Over 2000 delegates have arrived to the congress to vote on who becomes premier of the Soviet Union and other key issues. Everyone is anticipating the result of the vote on who becomes premier, with Shliapnikov already having support from a large minority he is a strong contender to Kirov."
sovietpol.1051.d:0 "After a rough and seemingly unending electoral process, the delegates have voted and the results have been drawn in. To nobody's surprise, Shliapnikov has risen as the winner of the vote and thus has been made the new premier of the Soviet Union. In his first speech as the new premier, he promised a new age of Leninism, only one featuring trade union control, democratic governance and a transparent bureaucracy. Despite his best attempts, some still reject his premiership and have called him a revisionist syndicalist."
sovietpol.1052.d:0 "After a rough and seemingly unending electoral process, the delegates have voted and the results have been drawn in. To nobody's surprise, Kirov has risen as the winner of the vote and thus has been made the new premier of the Soviet Union. This is an important moment in the history of the Soviet Union. In his first speech as the new premier, Kirov has asserted his intentions to continue Lenin's policies and to assert that the USSR does not fall to the hands of faux syndicalists like Shliapnikov."

sovietpol.1100.d:0 "As of today, Chairman Kalinin has been put under temporary house arrest and Mikhail Frunze declared the temporary Chairman. This move has caused great outrage with many denouncing the military coup as illegitimate, but Tukhachevsky himself refuses to step down and asserts that it is his duty to protect his motherland from Trotskyism."
sovietpol.1101.d:0 "Nearly all divions have deserted in favour of the opposition. However, the lack of coordination and distrust between most of those that have not yet accepted Tukhachevksy means that little progress has been made outside of a formal resistance towards him. Only time will tell if Tukhachevksy will be able to deal with these dissidents quickly enough to avoid being deposed."
sovietpol.1102.d:0 "Chairman Frunze held his first speech today. Before a crowd of hundreds, he denounced the deserting soldiers and politicians as traitors to the motherland and calls for unity against Trotskyism and capitalism. The speech was a success and Frunze was widely applauded by the largely sympathetic crowd."
sovietpol.1103.d:0 "A large protest has erupted against Kirov's coup! Demanding the immediate resignation of Frunze and Tukhachevsky, protesters have swarmed across Moscow and other cities in Russia. If we do not do anything, this could greatly destabilize the Soviet government and cause Tukhachevksy's premiership to lose momentum."
sovietpol.1104.d:0 "Tukhachevsky has sent his troops to suppress riots that have spread across Moscow and its surroundings. Orders to not back down regardless of the opposition presented have thus far resulted in 13 deaths and 565 injuries. This has greatly hurt our regime's legitimacy."
sovietpol.1105.d:0 "It seems that the responsibilities invested in Chairman Frunze have caused him stress, fatigue and the man appears ever more weakly. For many, Frunze's stance as a hardline Leninist and a man of litte personal ambition make him the only possible legitimizing feature of Tukhachevsky's rule. Should Frunze's illness prevail, Tukhachevsky will struggle to find as good of a chairman as him."
sovietpol.1106.d:0 "After days of fatigue and headaches, Frunze has passed away today to a stroke. His death marks a great setback for Tukhachevsky, who will be unlikely to find such a committed Leninist and honest man to serve as Chairman for this anti-Trotskyite junta."
sovietpol.1107.d:0 "Tukhachevsky now faces a hard decision- that of choosing chairman. Amongst the possible candidates are Nikolai Yezhov of the OGPU, the Soviet secret police, or Kliment Voroshilov, a high ranking general in the Red Army. However, these two men are very ambitious and could easily backstab Tukhachevksy, so a safer, albeit more unpopular, solution would be Tukhachevksy to simply install himself as both Chairman and Premier."
sovietpol.1108.d:0 "Voroshilov has recently directed harsh words against Tukhachevsky's choice to make Yezhov Chairman. Voroshilov is of the strong opinion that the sly secret police agent will simply backstab Tukhachevsky and install his own distorted vision of Leninism built on terror. Voroshilov's position as a high-ranking general that has been thus far supportive of Tukhachevksy, makes this very impactful on the current administration."
sovietpol.1109.d:0 "Yezhov's ascension to Chairman of the Soviet Union has also marked the beginning of a greatly expanded OGPU with a much larger budget and much larger powers, all for the sake of combatting anti-state terrorism. This have given Yezhov even larger control over the state than a normal chairman and has put Tukhachevksy in a dangerous situation."
sovietpol.1110.d:0 "Earlier this evening, Premier Tukhachevsky was assasinated by an unknown assasin in total cold-blood. While he prepared to make a speech in Moscow, a lone gunman shot him and the ensuing panic in the large crowd allowed this individual to quickly escape. Although many believe in the OGPU's involvement, no evidence has been found other than Yezhov greatly gaining from this absence of authority."
sovietpol.1111.d:0 "After a brief period of mourning for Tukhachevsky, Yezhov has completely taken over the role of Premier by using the OGPU to intimidate, bribe and jail his opponents and resistance. With an iron hand and tyrannical ambitions, a regime built on terror is likely to hereforth commence."
sovietpol.1112.d:0 "Yezhov has recently directed harsh words against Tukhachevsky's choice to make Voroshilov Chairman. He argues that the consolidation of authority in the USSR solely around the army will undermine socialism and that Voroshilov is not a man that can be truly trusted with any power. Indeed, while backed on doubtful arguments, Yezhov's position as leader of the OGPU greatly hurts the stability of our regime."
sovietpol.1113.d:0 "It seems that while Tukhachevksy is away solving governmental issues and spending time with bureaucrats and politicians, Voroshilov has been wielding his position as both General and Chairman to very excitedly expand his influence and reach in the Red Army. Should this rise in power of Voroshilov grow out of hand, it is possible he may be able to coup Tukhachevsky himself and climb to the premiership through blood and bullet."
sovietpol.1114.d:0 "It seems that the military conspirations of Voroshilov have finally given birth. After condemning and criticizing the overreliance of Tukhachevsky on the civilian administration and his sympathies to trade unions with fellow military officers and some high-ranking RKP members, Voroshilov marched into Tukhachevksy's unguarded residence at night and arrested him. On the following morning, Voroshilov promptly declared Tukhachevksy's imprisonment due to involvement in an anti-Soviet agreement with the trade unions and Valkists. He then pronounced the need for an immediate military buildup and reorganization of the USSR, in order to prevent further societal undermining from within and abroad, and publicaly made himself Premier for the sole purpose of accomplishing this goal."
sovietpol.1115.d:0 "Tukhachevsky's decision has been met with many critics throughout the USSR, who call it an authoritarian measure, and even Voroshilov and Yezhov have been found frowning at such a decision. Regardless, they can do little other than complain, now that Tukhachevksy completely controls both the government and the Red Army."
sovietpol.1116.d:0 "Kirov has organized a large opposition front against [Root.GetLeader]'s takeover, and him and his group have begun not only arming and fortifying their own authority and position, but mass-producing propaganda and spreading it to the population, calling for the restoration of the dictatorship of the proletariat to power, rather than the maintenance of this veiled military autocracy. If they will be successful or not remains to be seen, though many look positively to the chances of their success.."
sovietpol.1117.d:0 "Many RKP members have begun expressing their full support of Kirov. Followed by that, a large quantity of soviets declared the support for Kirov's goal. This is quite a massive hit as most of the economy is organized through autonomous soviets. Tukhachevksy apparently was largely outraged at this decision from the soviets, and now looks desperately for new allies, wherever they may be found."

sovietpol.1201.d:0 "The Ural-Siberian method is an attempt to garner support for the regime’s grain procurement policies among lower and middle class peasants, whilst isolating the kulaks at the same time.\n\nThe policy thus far has been received well, and many assemblies of villagers have endorsed the grain requisition plan that was imposed upon their village. Special commissions composed of poor and middle peasants then assigned grain requisition quotas to the village’s households according to a class approach. What this meant, at least in theory, was that the village would force the kulaks to turn over his “surplus” grain, thereby satisfying the lion’s share of the village’s assignment and perhaps even leaving some portion of grain over that could be shared with the poor.\n\nKulak households that failed to fulfill their assignments could be assessed a fine of five times the value of grain owed-the infamous piatikratka—and failing to deliver this assessment, they could face up to one year of forced labor under the provisions of article 61 of the penalcode. In cases when groups of households resisted their assignments, the penalty was “confinement for up to two years, accompanied by confiscation of property and their exile from the locality.""
sovietpol.1202.d:0 "We have undetaken an intensification of repressive measures in grain procurements. We have ordered the OGPU to increase its campaign against urban speculators and grain traders with ties to the town. We also are removing collective farm leaders guilty of retaining grain surpluses or of selling them on the side, we also have ordered the OGPU to take swift measures against kulaks who organize terrorist acts. The punishment is up to and including execution."
sovietpol.1203.d:0 "Today [Root.GetLeader] held a speech ascertaining the success of collectivization. 'The past year was a year of great breakthroughs on all the fronts of socialist construction. The keynote of this breakthrough has been, and continues to be, a determined offensive of socialism against the capitalist elements in town and countryside. The characteristic feature of this offensive is that it has already brought us a number of decisive successes in the principal spheres of the socialist reconstruction of our national economy. We may, therefore, conclude that our party succeeded to organize the change and to launch a successful offensive against capitalist elements.\nFinally, about the party’s third achievement during the past year. I am referring to the radical change in the development of our agriculture from small, backward, individual farming to large-scale, advanced, collective agriculture, to joint cultivation of the land, to machine and tractor stations, to artels, to collective farms based on modern technique, and, finally, to giant state farms, equipped with hundreds of tractors. The party’s achievement here consists in the fact that in a whole number of areas we have succeeded in turning the main mass of the peasantry away from the old, capitalist path of development—which benefits only a small group of the rich, while the vast majority of the peasants are doomed to ruin and utter poverty—to the new, socialist path of development, which pushes out the rich, and reequips the middle and poor peasants along new lines, equipping them with modern implements, with tractors and agricultural machinery, so as to enable them to climb out of poverty. The achievement of the party consists in the fact that we have succeeded in organizing this radical change deep down in the peasantry itself, and insecuring the following of the broad masses of the poor and middle peasants in spite of incredible difficulties, in spite of the desperate resistance of dark forces of every kind, from kulaks to priests and philistines.\n\nAll that has collapsed and crumbled to dust as old bourgeois-liberal rubbish. Now even the blind can see that if there is any serious dissatisfaction among the main mass of the peasantry it is not because of the collective-farm policy of the Soviet government but because the Soviet government is unable to keep pace with the growth of the collective-farm movement in regard to supplying the peasants with machines and tractors. It is obvious that, as long as there was no mass collective-farm movement, the “highroad” was the lower forms of the cooperative movement—supply and marketing cooperatives; but when the higher form of the cooperative movement—the collective farm—appeared, the latter became the “highroad” of development. Third, now even the blind can see that without the offensive against the capitalist elements in the countryside, and without the development of the collective-farm and state-farm movement, we would not have achieved the decisive successes of this year in the matter of grain procurement, nor could the state have accumulated, as it has already done, an emergency reserve of grain totaling tens of millions of poods. Moreover, it can now be confidentially asserted that, thanks to the growth of the collective-farm and state-farm movement, we are definitely emerging, or have already emerged, from the grain crisis. And if the development of the collective farms and state farms is accelerated, there is noreason to doubt that in about three years’ time our country will be one of the world’s largest grain producers, if not the largest.'"
sovietpol.1204.d:0 "We finally managed to secure an emergency grain reserve. This will give us room to maneuver in the event of foreign or domestic war. This has been hailed as a great success and propaganda makers have already caught the sniff of it to produce romanticizations of the proud Soviet peasants and their hard work."
sovietpol.1205.d:0 "After the failure of the institution of suppressive measures against rowdy peasants, large-scale agrarian revolts have begun popping, like pimples, across the Union. Even those that were not put under these strict conditions, have become restless due to the fear that they may be soon subjected to similar policies. This will make enforcing the measures a lot harder, as any increase in intensity will just increase the opposition of peasants to the collectivization and the regime itself."
sovietpol.1206.d:0 "The newly created twenty-five-thousanders are causing havoc across the countryside. They officially only are allowed to use force against kulaks, but middle and lower class peasants were soon sucked into the maelstrom of conflict. Regardless, they report that kulaks have still been expelled from their holdings and their stock and implements handed over to the collective farms, which is always a great achievement."
sovietpol.1207.d:0 "The Central Commitee had projected the collectivization of 9.6 percent of the peasant population after one year of collectivization. But we were able to surpass this and were able to collectivize [?collectivization] percent of the farmland. This is a great success and a great boon for our campaign of the collectivization of the farmland, as it shows how successfull our campaign is."
sovietpol.1208.d:0 "Today a study by the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate on the perspective of the collectivized agriculture has been released. It reports that there is a complete lack of planning in collective farm construction. As a consequence, they state, is that the collective farms are growing spontaneously through the use of campaign methods in certain regions where local party organizations had assumed the reins. Their leaders are poorly informed and unqualified; they receive almost no assistance from local land and cooperative agencies; and they receive little economic aid from the state."
sovietpol.1209.d:0 "Most peasants have been resenting our policy of mass collectivization. They perceive a good education as a way to leave the collective farms and move to the cities. If they start moving en masse to the cities then this will disrupt the collectivization, so we should look into preventing this from happening."
sovietpol.1210.d:0 "Peasants are fleeing the farmland en masse, since they hope for a better live in the cities unlike the atrocious live on the farmlands. If we don't act fast this will disrupt our programm of mass collectivization."
sovietpol.1211.d:0 "Peasants are becoming very resentful against the government. Since the state has welfare obligations for them in their mind. They also blame Premier [Root.GetLeader] for all their problems since joining a collective farm."
sovietpol.1212.d:0 "Peasants are starting to direct their anger against the government for collectivization towards the members of their own village society. Feuds and family squabbles, resentments toward the new inequalities in the village are tearing down any dreams of peasant solidarity."
sovietpol.1214.d:0 "Party officials tasked with collectivization have begun competiting with each other for better and better progress in their respective regions, seeking thus to use these successes to propel their position in the party. As one might expect, this excessive competition has not warranted the best outcomes and has only made the lives of peasants harder."
sovietpol.1215.d:0 "The chaos that collectivization caused in many rural areas has made it easy for bandits and criminals to rob the population. This is greatly hurting our reputation in the peasantry, as they don't see us as able to protect them from the bandits and criminals."
sovietpol.1216.d:0 "Peasants are prematurely killing off their livestock in order to prevent them from being collectivized. The slaughtering of the cattle and sheep has resulted in a massive reduction of leather and wool for consumer goods."
sovietpol.1230.d:0 "A commission was created by the Politburo, at the recommendation of Boris Petrovich Sheboldaev, with Yakov Arkadyevich Yakovlev as chairman of the commission. The commission is supposed to create a collectivization decree in two weeks and would consist of eight subcommittees. Commission members were drawn largely from relevant central agencies and from among the secretaries of the provincial party committees of grain-producing regions."
sovietpol.1231.d:0 "The commission has completed a draft of the collectivization decree and has submitted it to the Pulitburo. While the draft doesn't have an exact schedule for the collectivization, it suggests that it would likely be completed within five years and in the main grain-producing areas, within two to three years, with a highlight that this can come possibly even sooner in some districts.\n\n The main focus of the draft however is on organizational, production, and managerial issues. The draft decree’s authors warns that numbers alone are no basis for evaluating the success of the movement, a clear reference to the previous months’ leap in collectivization percentages in the ongoing 'race for percentages' among provincial officials. It was also clear from the draft that the so-called material-technical base for large-scale collectivized agriculture was not in place and that the countryside would continue to rely on animal draft power and simple implements for the foreseeable future while awaiting the mass production of tractors and other agricultural machinery.\n\nThe draft stresses the centrality of the artel as the basic form of collective farm at the current stage, noting that each further step toward socialization along the path to the commune must be based on the firsthand experience of collective-farm peasants and on their growing conviction regarding the durability, benefit, and advantage of collective forms of farm management.\n\nThe draft also maintains that “special caution must be displayed in the realm of domestic life, where the ordinary peasant’s prejudices are deepest,”. Finally, the draft decree carries a series of strong warnings against the application of “administrative enthusiasms” (a euphemism for force) in collectivization."
sovietpol.1232.d:0 "Yakovlev, however, is chalenged by Boris Petrovich Sheboldaev and Andrey Andreyevich Andreyev, first secretaries, respectively, of the Lower Volga and Northern Caucasus party organizations, whose regions are leading the country in collectivization at this time and who were stead fast proponents of what Mendel Khatayevich calls the “fast pace” and of what they, like [Root.GetLeader], labeled a “tumultuous movement from below.”\n\nAlthough Khatayevich told his provincial party organization that he “basically agreed” with Yakovlev, he hedges by arguing that “we must not allow talk of ‘a lack of organizational capabilities’ to cover up our lag behind real life” and by accusing one of his own county party committees of “disloyalty” to the region for suggesting a lower collectivization pace. Khataevich was more cautious in regard to the issue of socialization. He criticized elements within his own party organization who pushed for what he called “evangelical socialism, under which everything down to the last hen is socialized. ”He presciently wstmd that peasant women—the “weak spot” in collective-farm  construction—would  resist  excessive  socialization  and notes his general agreement with Yakovlev’s relatively more moderate approach while differing with him on the matter of the socialization of commercial livestock."
sovietpol.1233.d:0 "Yakovlev has sat down with [Root.GetLeader] and revisited the decree to finalize it. With [Root.GetLeader]’s prodding, the pace of wholesale collectivization was set and increased, most technical issues regarding organization and production were cut, and any concerns about peasant “experience” or “prejudice” were eliminated. Warnings against collectivization “by decree” remained but fell into second place behind warnings to “struggle against any attempts to hold back the development of the collective-farm movement”"
sovietpol.1234.d:0 "The decree was published nationally in the press following its approval. It is a landmark in regime-peasant relations, serving to launch the collectivization campaign on a scale and at a pace unanticipated by the pronouncements of the November plenum and even by [Get.Leader] and his most radical supporters.\n\nThe decree unleashed a campaign, on both central and provincial levels, with only the vaguest of guidelines and a fairly open-ended mandate to forge ahead. The decree itself is based on a series of dangerously false assumptions as well as on a national collectivist mind-set that was loath at this point “to organize everything in advance” lest what [Root.GetLeader] called the “tumultuous, mass movement” be stifled.\n\nThe decree maintains that “we have the material base to replace large-scale kulak production with large-scale production by collective farms” as a way to rationalize both the collectivization and dekulakization campaigns. In fact, as V. P. Danilov’s early work demonstrated,the technical level of Soviet agriculture is woefully low, the “tractorization” of the countryside lay in the future, and the village was nowhere near being technically prepared for collectivization. The decree also overestimates the peasantry’s willingness and capacity to collectivize by positing absurdly high targets for the collectivization campaign, choosing to ignore the fact—implicitly to endorse it—that high rates of collectivization have been achieved largely as a result of provincial campaigns based on coercion and socialist competition between districts and counties. Even more ominously, the decree states that the artel was “transitional to the commune,” thus legitimizing the proposal of unbridled push for all-out socialization of properties down to the household poultry and the formation of communes based on the complete socialization of property and everyday life."
sovietpol.1235.d:0 "A new courtyard game has been spawning, named Search and Requisition, in this game one group plays the role of a requisitioning brigade and another act as ‘kulaks’ hiding grain."
sovietpol.1236.d:0 "Kulaks have been divided into three classes. The first consists of about 63,000 ‘counter-revolutionary’ families who will be executed or exiled and have their property confiscated. Group two is made up of 150,000 households labelled ‘exploiters’ or ‘active  opponents’ of collectivisation. These will be deported to the remote regions of the east and north, but permitted to retain some possessions. Another group is composed of between 396,000 and 852,000 households who were to be allowed to remain in their home region but on land outside the collectives, the land that those kulaks receive are not arable."
sovietpol.1237.d:0 "The OGPU has been ordered by [Root.GetLeader] to start a cleansing of kulak elements from the countryside, with the aim of the destroying kulaks as a class. As first ordered that OGPU PPs, short for regional plenipotentiary representatives, in the north, the Urals, Siberia and the Far East report on locations for resettlement and the numbers of kulaks that could be settled in the region. Then OGPU’s Secret Operations Department was ordered to determine the regions where arrests and exiles must occur first and, to report on the numbers of arrests in the last six months, the numbers of “counter-revolutionary” organizations to be liquidated, the numbers of kulaks to go to concentration camps, where it would be necessary to open new camps, and whether it would be possible to organize kulak villages without guards."
sovietpol.1238.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader] has issued a telegram on dekulakization to plenipotentiary representatives in the Northern Caucasus, the Central Black Earth Region,mLower Volga, Middle Volga, the Urals, and Siberia stating that information from a series of places told of the beginnings of a “spontaneous” exile and expropriation of kulaks, meaning dekulakization by provincial or local officials—decidedly not peasant-initiated dekulakization. The telegram tells plenipotentiary representatives to ensure that measures are taken to raise the issue in party organizations to carry out the campaign in an organized way according to OGPU directives. They further warned plenipotentiary representatives to ensure that Red Army families were not among the exiles and to hasten the submission of exile plans with all calculations and maps to the OGPU."
sovietpol.1239.d:0 "1. Repeal the applicability of laws on the leasing of land and the use of hired labor in agriculture (sections VII and VIII of the General Principle sof Land Use and Land Reorganization) to individual peasant farms in raions of wholesale collectivization. Exceptions to this rule with respect to middle-peasant farms must be regulated by raion executive committees under the leadership and supervision of the okrug executive committee\n\n2. Confiscate from kulaks in these raions their means of production, livestock, farm and residential structures, processing enterprises, and fodder and seed reserves.\n\n3. At the same time, in order to resolutely undermine the kulaks’ influence on certain segments of the poor and middle peasantry and completely suppress any attempts at counterrevolutionary resistance by the kulaks to the measures being implemented by Soviet power and collective farms, take the following measures against the kulaks:\na. Category 1—immediately liquidate the counterrevolutionary kulak aktiv elements by incarcerating them in concentration camps, not stopping at the death penalty for organizers of terrorist acts, counterrevolutionary disturbances, and insurrectionist organizations;\nb. Category 2 should be comprised of the remaining elements of the kulak aktiv, especially the richest kulaks and quasi-landowners, who are to be exiled to remote localities of the USSR and, within the borders of a given region, to remote areas of the region;\nc. Category 3 consists of kulaks who are left within the borders of the raion; they are to be resettled on new land plots allotted to them outside collective farms.\n\n4. The number of kulak farms liquidated in each of the three categories must be strictly differentiated by raion, depending on the actual number of kulak farms in the raion, so that the total number of liquidated farms in all of the principal raions amounts to an average of about 3–5 percent. This guideline (3–5 percent) is designed to concentrate the strike on genuinely kulak farms and to prevent these measures under any circumstances from being extended to any segment of middle-peasant farms. The families of Red Army men and commanders of the RKKA [Workers’ and Peasants’ Red Army] are not subject to exile or confiscation. As for kulaks whose family members have been working at factories and plants for a long time, an especially careful approach must be employed, and the position of the relevant persons not only in the countryside but also in the relevant factory organizations should be ascertained."
sovietpol.1240.d:0 "The Politburo has issued a decree instructing the Central Committee’s Organizational Bureau to issue a directive on the closing of churches as well as issuing orders to purge industrial enterprises of “individual kulak elements” and “to take decisive measures in higher educational and higher technical educational institutions to combat counterrevolutionary youth groups linked to kulak elements.”"

sovietpol.1300.d:0 "Intourist, the state tourist agency of Soviet Russia, was founded in 1929 to accommodate internal and foreign travelling. Being a state company, the organisation has a practical monopoly on tourism in the country, and possesses hundreds of restaurants, hotels, currency exchanges, bus companies and boats. Every year, hundreds of thousands of people’s travels are taken care of. The most popular destinations are Moscow, Leningrad and the Caucaus, the ‘soviet riviera’. It also offers workers who have performed very well in taking their quota some very cheap vacations in one of the many sanatoria and hotels lying next to the Black Sea coast. Intourist is not only important for travelling though: it fulfils a major role in portraying the Soviet Union as a workers’ paradise and showing foreign visitors the superiority of the socialist system, and it provides the state with some much needed hard (western) currencies."
sovietpol.1301.d:0 "Our action of ending press censorship has resulted in the press now regularly criticizing us if we fail with a campaign or a policy. We should be more cautious now with our actions as the press will report any failure they can report. But them being able to criticize us might force a lot of party members and government officials to end their corruption and engage themself more with the people, else they will lose face in the public."
sovietpol.1302.d:0 "Vasili Zhuravlov’s new masterpiece, Cosmic Voyage, had its premiere today, with thousands of people going to watch the movie on the first day. The science-fiction movie is set in the year 1946, in which the soviet space program is having some problems. Professor Karin denounces his concurrent, professor Sedikh, for being too old and mentally unstable. However, professor Sedikh and his assistant Marina disregard professor Karin's critiques and make a successful landing on the moon, where, unfortunately, some problems occur, threatening the lives of the first two people of the moon. Luckily, they manage to survive and the cosmonauts were able to return to Moscow. It is one of the first films in history to realistically depict a spaceflight and the thereby belonging weightlessness, already receiving positive reviews of several scientists and movie lovers."
sovietpol.1303.d:0 "Vladimir Lenin's health has been decreasing and decreasing for a long time, but no one expected this to happen this soon. This is a disaster since Vladimir Lenin was the only thing keeping the different political factions from backstabbing and fighting each other, as he was beloved by most members in the communist party, regardless of which faction they belong. We can only hope that he recovers and prevents an utter collapse of the Soviet Union and hopefully ends the political divide between the factions."
sovietpol.1304.d:0 "Peasants have always been neglected by the Soviet government, because of their "petty-bourgeois nature." But the stability of the Soviet government prevented them to protest their treatment by the government. But with Lenin's demise and the following chaos they have finally started to revolt against the government and call for equal treatment of peasants and workers."
sovietpol.1305.d:0 "The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions has been preparing a general strike, after the revolt of the peasants. The reasons for them planning to do a general strike is the Soviet government neglecting the light and heavy industry and nearly exclusively focusing on the armament industry. They also are criticizing the lack of welfare provied by the state."
sovietpol.1306.d:0 "The workers unified behind the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions now have stopped doing their work and have gone to the street and started protesting the government's policies in regards of the prioritization of the armament industry over the heavy and light industry. While they aren't powerful enough to depose our government, they are able to drastically destabilize the Soviet economy, as our light and heavy industry is rather sparse so any obstruction of those sectors might cause a total economic breakdown."
sovietpol.1307.d:0 "Railway workers have joined the general strike. This has turned the situation even worse for the government as now communication between the different state is slowly breaking together. To make this situation worse some railway workers even started to destroy parts of the railways, this will be very costly and worse the political storm we are experiencing at the moment."
sovietpol.1308.d:0 "The deep political crisis following Lenin's death has finally took its toll on the economy, causing an utter economic breakdown. As workers and peasants are revolting, most factories are left empty with no one inside to work and most farmland is now fallow.\n\nWe can only hope that we will be able to weather the storm and rejuvenate our economy, and finally start a grand industrialization campaign."
sovietpol.1309.d:0 "With the Soviet Union in such a political and economic crisis most people don't have the money the money to buy our state newspaper, the Pravda, other however simply don't but our state newspaper out of protest. This has left us missing important funds to reinvigorate the economy."
sovietpol.1310.d:0 "Students have been rising up, as most students oppose Lenin's authoritarian policies. The government has been sending in the police to suppress them. This has resulted in violent clashes between students and police, while the police is winning most of those fights it has cost us much popularity."
sovietpol.1311.d:0 "After the start of the general strike lead by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, a lot of people came out in opposition to the general strike seeing it unnecessary cause of more instability in these trying times."
sovietpol.1312.d:0 "Today Kirov has held a speech, in this speech he calls for the unity of the people behind the state in order to end the anarchy and chaos and bring back stability to the state. Since Kirov is very charismatic  his speech was a big success. Because of the success of the speech his standing politcally has improved by quite a bit making him a serious contender for the office of Premier."
sovietpol.1313.d:0 "Rumous of a planned takeover led by Leon Trotsky have been surfacing. This has caused many politcians to be anxious as Leon Trotsky is extremely powerful, with the opposition of most other politicians being his biggest hinderance of gaining power."
sovietpol.1314.d:0 "A meeting has been called between important generals, like Marshal Voroshilov, Marshal Frunze and Marshal Tukhachevsky and Yezhov, leader of the OGPU. Since many important politicans and generals attended the meeting there has been a lot of rumours and discussions regarding the topic, but no information about the meeting has been leaked or released."
sovietpol.1315.d:0 "Today Molotov, Bukharin and Zinoviev have annnounced their intention of cooperating in order to prevent a takeover from Trotsky and bring back Stability to the Soviet Union. Even though all of them vary extremely politically, they are united in their opposition to Trotsky."
sovietpol.1316.d:0 "The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions has announced that it has ended the general strike, because they were not able to uphold the strike. While they still are opposing our government, the end of the general strike is a great help in ending the chaos."
sovietpol.1317.d:0 "The economy has finally recovered from the economic breakdown. While we still need to stabilize the nation, the end of the economic chaos has given us the power to finally end the chaos."
sovietpol.1318.d:0 "The Soviets have endorsed Sergey Kirov as their preferred Premier of the Soviet Union. The reason for the endorsement were Kirov's strong following of Lenin's ideas from which the Soviets are highly profiting from, as the Libertarians wants to give control to the workers and the National Collectivists want to implement a planned economy."
sovietpol.1319.d:0 "Our political crisis has finally ended after the new government took over. But there still is a giant political divide between the different factions, which hinders our government from functioning effectively."
sovietpol.1320.d:0 "Sergey Kirov has became the new temporary Premier, after Lenin's wife revealed a letter from Lenin which stated that Sergey Kirov was his preferred heir. While he won't be the new Premier until the 26th Congress, which will take place next year, has taken place. But it will help the Soviet Union to regain some sense of stability as it now finally got a leader again."
sovietpol.1321.d:0 "Mikhail Tukhachevsky has stormed Moscow, our capital, and declared a state of emergency. He was accompanied by a few of his most loyal troops and some high ranking generals, some of them were Marshal Voroshilov and Marshal Frunze, and Yezhov the leader of the OGPU. This event has shocked many, even if there were some hintings, the biggest one was the meeting between important generals and Yezhov."

sovietpol.1322.d:0 "Between 1919 and 1926, the geologist Urvantsev undertook an expedition to the eastern foothills of the Putorana Plateau to search for large deposits of coal and polymetallic ores. In 1921, Urvantsev built a small wooden house and further researched the geological composition and structures of the underground there. Because of the large deposits of natural resources in the region, the government has decided to initiate the construction of the ‘Norilsk Combinate’. This big construction project includes the building of several steel mills, residential blocks, streets, a power plant and other provisions. The building of this new city provides re-educational work for people who have posed a threat to our political system: the hard work will be healing for them and will suppress their perfidious thoughts. Most importantly, their valuable labour will accelerate the building of the socialist state by cheaply providing the resources our expanding economy needs."
sovietpol.1323.d:0 "A film by Soviet animation studios Soyuzmultfilm has recently been released– a new animated film known as 'Otkroveniye'. This animated film takes place in 1957, in a world ruled by a tyrannical Valkist regime. The fortified city of Moscow remains as the last bastion of freedom and socialism worldwide. The protagonist of this film is a young boy named Dmitry, a patriotic Soviet youth, who volunteers to join an elite squadron of children that command seventy feet tall armored vehicles known as the "Otkroveniye". Dmitry, along with two other Otkroveniye "Kapitans", face off massive monstrosities sieging Moscow known as the the "Schutz". These Schutz monstrosities have been created by the Valkist regime with the eventual goal of capturing the last bastion of free humanity and then finally destroying the world with ancient Germanic artifacts with esoteric powers.The film follows the relationship between the Kapitans and the battles that they fight against the Schutz. The film features a massive battle at the end between the Otkroveniye and the leader of the Valkists and the creators of the Schutz. The Otkroveniye achieve victory as they defeat the Schutz, sparking a worldwide revolution against the Valkist empire and humanity is liberated under global socialism.\n\nSoviet critics have acclaimed this film as the "greatest fairy tale of the 20th century", especially praising its small psychological themes. The film has even made its way to small film circles in the west based around foreign animation, where fans have begun playing Otkroveniye in smaller theaters subtitled in their native language. The release of Otkroveniye has even sparked the creation of some small obscure counterculture circles based around an interest in Soviet and proletarian film, animation, literature, and culture. Members of these circles have begun calling themselves 'Podrazhatels' (Russian for 'mimics'), with many so-called Podrazhatels learning how to speak Russian and applying for visas to visit the Soviet Union. However, these small groups are almost completely unknown to the public and are only found in a few of the larger western cities."
sovietpol.1324.d:0 "A housing shortage has been developing in most cities since we have started to dramatically expand the urbanization of our country, this has resulted in a lot of dissatisfaction in the cities by the people who have live on the street or in very small appartments."
sovietpol.1325.d:0 "In order to midigate the housing shortage we have organized communal apartments, or kommunalki, accommodating typically a family per room with one shared kitchen and toilet. By getting people to live communally, we believe they could become more collective in nature: private space and property will disappear; family life will be replaced by Communist fraternity and organization; and the individual will be subjected to themutual surveillance and control of the community.\n\nSome houses were designed for this by Constructivist architects, named 'commune houses'. In those houses all the property, including even clothes, will be shared by the inhabitants, domestic tasks like cooking and child care would be assigned to teams on a rotating basis, and everybody would sleep in one big dormitory, divided by gender, with private rooms for sex."
sovietpol.1326.d:0 "The Soviet Union has been in the process of the latinising since 1929. This process has been supported by most of the party in order to make it a lot easier to assimalate people in the Soviet Union that will encompass all of the world. One of the most important person who was in support of this is Anatoly Lunacharsky, the Commissar of Enlightenment. Now with the latinisation of the Soviet Union complete, a great achievement has been made which will show the people the modernity of the Soviet government."
sovietpol.1327.d:0 "The Soviet government under the order from [Root.GetLeader] has ended the process of latinisation which has been started in 1929. The latinisation was popular around most Soviet politicians as it would help them assimalate other people when they would start exporting the revolution, but [Root.GetLeader] has a way more isolationist approach, focusing now more on the development of the Soviet Union instead of export the revolution."
sovietpol.1328.d:0 "The Silver Age of Russian poetry was a period that started in the 1890s and was a period of exceptionally creative poetry. The new repressive regime under [Root.GetLeader] has forced many poets to either fleeing, voluntarily leaving the movement or being executed by the government. This has resulted in the end of this period."
sovietpol.1329.d:0 "Most orthodox socialists oppose the use of assembly lines, instead opting for craft shops as a place for the workers, as even Karl Marx opposed them because the workers should see thee products should be 'mirrors in which workers see their reflected essential nature'. But [Get.Leader] opposes this assertation and has started establishing assembly lines in most factories."
sovietpol.1330.d:0 "We have started to expand and modernize craft shops. As this is the way Marx wanted to the production of products to be, instead of assembly lines, because they aren not mirrors of workers in which they can see their reflected essential nature."
sovietpol.1331.d:0 "Imaginism is a poetic movement which advocates for poetry based on a series of arresting and unusual images. The biggest poets of the movement are Vadim Shershenevich, Ryurik Ivnev, Sergey Yesenin and Anatoly Mariengof. Imaginist poets are known for reading at cafés and on stages and drew public attention for the atmosphere of literary scandal they created as well as for their outstanding poetic talent."
sovietpol.1332.d:0 "Nikolai Bukharin has been known for being in support of the Bezbozhnik, or The Godless, an anti-religious newspaper since he attended their conference on cultural atheism in 1925. Now he publically endorsed the newspaper, this has increased the popularity of the newspaper tremendously. The newspaper has been known for its radical anti-religious contents, the biggest targets of them are Judaism and Christianity. In one magazine they accused rabbis and priests of collaborating with the bourgeoisie and other counter-revolutionaries. In another one they said peasants were parasites, who lived of the work of peasants."
sovietpol.1333.d:0 "While the movement named new Soviet man has been existing since the Soviet Union was established, the new government under [Root.GetLeader] has officially supported this movement. One of the biggest reasons for the support of the movement was to prevent the grow of Trotskyism. The movement wants to create a new person which is selfless, learned, healthy, muscular, and enthusiastic in spreading Socialism, the person also has no nationalist sentiment."
sovietpol.1334.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader] has started to fight the 'bourgeoisie family', since they see it as socially harmful - a stronghold of religion, patriarchaloppression and ‘egotistic love’. We have started to weaken famility ties, by making divorces a lot easier, this has resulted in the highest divorce rate in the world."
sovietpol.1335.d:0 "The Red Army Choir, officially the Red-bannered Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble of the USSR, is our most well known choir for the army. The initiator for the creation of the choir was Felix Nikolaevich Danilovich, a theatre director. The first director of the ensemble was chosen from three of Moscow's conductors: Danilin, Chesnokov and Alexandrov.\n\nIn 1929, the choir visited the Russian Far East, entertaining the troops working on the Far Eastern Railway. In 1935, the choir was bestowed the Order of the Red Banner and was renamed the Red-bannered Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble of the USSR." 
sovietpol.1336.d:0 "One of the most popular courtyard game since the 1920s has been 'Reds and Whites', a Soviet Cowboys and Indians in which the events of the Russian Civil War are being played out by the children, often using air-guns marketed especially for the game."
sovietpol.1337.d:0 "'Specialist Baiting' has become a popular sport under [Root.GetLeader]. The sport comprises of forcing industrial experts to confess to wrecking and other heinous crimes. Because of this thousands of 'bourgeois' or non-party engineers. If a machine broke down under the supervision of an engineer, then the engineer would be charged with wrecking."
sovietpol.1338.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader] has issued a decree which forces every Jew in Russia to renounce their religion and adopt a Russian name, or face the threat of deportion and confiscation of their land. Synagogues across the nation are being closed aswell, since they harbor anti-Soviet traitors in the eyes of [Root.GetLeader]."
