#### Events ####
trt.1.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire"
trt.1.d:0 "When [Root.GetNameDef] had joined the Great War on the side of the Central Powers, they had not expected the tough battle and disastrous defeat that followed. The conclusion of the Great War had saw [Root.GetNameDef] nearly dissolve, with the British fanning the flames for Arabian nationalism in the empire’s Arabian vilayets. In addition, when [Root.GetNameDef] was forced to the negotiation table, they were occupied and carved up by the Entente powers – namely Britain, Greece, France, and Italy.\n\nWhat remained of the Ottoman Empire, which was now limited to Anatolia and Constantinople, was forced to accept a government of the Entente’s choosing, with the Sultan as a figurehead. Thus, the Freedom and Entente Party had taken power in the nation, under the guidance of the Entente.\n\nWhat followed after was a revolt by Mustafa Kemal Paşa, a brigadier general in the Ottoman Army, who had sought to kick out the imperialists from Turkey and modernize the nation. A joint Anglo-Greek intervention force ended these dreams, when Mustafa Kemal and his group of revolutionaries were all defeated in a short, but bloody, battle.\n\nEver since the aforementioned event, the Sultan, Abdülmecid II, has managed to hold onto power, with the backing of the Entente. However, the political situation is very turbulent, with factionalism very much prevalent, and may crack at any time..."
trt.1.a:0 "Aman Tanrım!"

trt.2.t:0 "The Assassination of the Sultan!"
trt.2.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events, it seems as though the Sultan, Abdülmecid II was recently assassinated by an [Root.GetAdjective] revolutionary, who was reportedly unhappy with the state of [Root.GetNameDef]. This event has come as a shock to not only many within our nation, but also international observers, all of whom are attempting to come to terms with the situation. While tensions within [Root.GetNameDef] had been high following our disastrous defeat in the Great War, nobody had thought that it would come to this.\n\nAs it stands, the House of Osman is attempting to consolidate their power in an attempt to avoid the collapse of the nation, and an emergency session has been scheduled by the General Assembly to discuss the future of [Root.GetNameDef]. Whatever may come of this, however, is yet to be seen. Many are worried that this could lead the empire to finally fall..."
trt.2.a:0 "This does not bode well..."

trt.3.t:0 "The General Assembly Convenes"
trt.3.d:0 "The most influential and powerful of the various parties and factions within [Root.GetNameDef] have assembled together today in an attempt to determine the fate of [Root.GetNameDef]. As it stands, the state of our empire is very turbulent, with unease and uncertainty both hanging in the air as the nation awaits the decision of the General Assembly. The people themselves, who feel as though they are helpless and unable to change the current situation, have turned their attention towards this emergency meeting which will determine the stability and unity of our empire – or the lack thereof.\n\nWhile a majority of the attendees, especially those from the House of Osman and the Freedom and Entente Party, support the swift consolidation of power under the House of Osman. However, an ever growing minority, mostly comprised of the Kemalists and Turanists, have been petitioning for the destruction of the empire and the rebirth of a new Turkish nation, with voting now beginning.\n\nWith voting now over, and the votes being tallied, the attendees are now holding their breath, waiting to see what the results of the vote show.\n\nAs the final votes have now been counted, it has just been announced that..."
trt.3.a:0 "The empire is no more!"
trt.3.b:0 "The empire stands strong!"

trt.4.t:0 "The Dissolution of the Empire!"
trt.4.d:0 "In what many have called a very close vote, it seems as though that, against all odds, the Kemalist and Turanist platforms have managed to succeed, with a slim majority of delegates voting in favour of the abolition of the Ottoman Empire. The state itself will be dissolved promptly, with the creation of a new Turkish state rising from its ashes.\n\nThe Kemalists and Turanists have argued for a state that is focused exclusively on supporting the needs and whims of the Turkish people rather than the wider Muslim world. This, of course, will not endear us to other Islamic nations as with the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire comes the dissolution of the Caliphate.\n\nThere are, however, other matters to consider with one of them being the election between the Kemalists and the Turanists, who will have to convince the delegates in attendance to vote for them to lead the new Turkish state.\n\nAs the voting is beginning, yet again, it seems though most of the people are in favour of the Kemalists leading the new state, yet the Turanists may be able to scrape by with a victory.\n\nWith the votes now tallied it seems as though..."
trt.4.a:0 "The Turanists have won!"
trt.4.b:0 "The Kemalists have won!"

trt.5.t:0 "The Empire Stands Strong!"
trt.5.d:0 "As expected, it seems as though an overwhelming majority of the delegates in attendance have voted for [Root.GetNameDef] to remain in order to ensure the preservation of not only the state, but also the stability within the state and would rather see it reformed from within than completely dissolved.\n\nWhile, politically speaking, this has not endeared us to the opposition, mainly the Kemalists and Turanists, it is to be said that many within and without [Root.GetNameDef] are breathing a sigh of relief as their investments and commitments within the empire have remained secure.\n\nHowever, we must also turn our attention towards the selection of a new heir to take the place of the late Sultan Abdülmecid II and lead our empire to glory. As it stands, there are two contenders for the throne: Ahmed Nihad Efendi, the grandson of the former Sultan Mehmed V, who is much more moderate and calls for the liberalization of the empire. Or Osman Fuad Efendi, son of Şehzade Mehmed Selahaddin, who opts to restore the empire to its former glory through conquest and militarization, while also empowering the post of the Sultan. Both sides have gained admirers and dissidents but only one can hope to win.\n\nWho shall we choose to lead [Root.GetNameDef]?"
trt.5.a:0 "Ahmed Nihad Efendi!"
trt.5.b:0 "Osman Fuad Efendi!"

trt.6.t:0 "The Fate of the House of Osman"
trt.6.d:0 "Following the recent victory of [Root.GetLeader] as the president of [Root.GetNameDef] and the subsequent dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, it has recently come to our attention that the House of Osman and its members, who still possess significant clout within [Root.GetNameDef] and the Islamic world, must be dealt with and their status in the [Root.GetAdjective] nation determined\n\nAs it stands, we have a two options available to us: we can either exile the family, sending them off and leaving them to their fate or we can allow them to remain within our borders but remove their political influence entirely. Particularly anti-monarchist and revolutionary elements within [Root.GetNameDef] have suggested that we merely execute the royal family and its members, but this could harm our reputation within the wider international community.\n\nWe must, however, make a choice, and act decisively. What shall we do?"
trt.6.a:0 "Allow them to remain."
trt.6.b:0 "Exile them."
trt.6.c:0 "Execute them."

trt.7.t:0 "A New Era"
trt.7.kemalist:0 "With the Ottoman Empire, a decadent entity, now officially dissolved, we can finally turn our attention towards the establishment and consolidation of a new [Root.GetAdjective] nation under the guidance of the Republican People’s Party.\n\nThat being said, however, the path that we have undertaken will not be an easy one to traverse. As it stands, the general feeling throughout the air has been one of uncertainty as the people are unsure of whether or not the decision to dissolve the empire was a correct one.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges our new regimes faces is brining about prosperity and ensuring stability within the new [Root.GetName]. With that in mind, however, we can begin to enter the world anew and hopefully right our wrongs."
trt.7.turanist:0 "With the Ottoman Empire, a decadent entity, now officially dissolved, we can finally turn our attention towards the establishment and consolidation of a new [Root.GetAdjective] nation under the guidance of the Turanist Party.\n\nThat being said, however, the path that we have undertaken will not be an easy one to traverse.

trt.7.a:0 "A light at the end of the tunnel..."

trt.8.t:0 "Standing Firm"
trt.8.moderate:0 "Thankfully, we have managed to stand firm against any sort of opposition that may have sought to dissolve the empire and potentially destabilize our great nation. This does not mean all is right within [Root.GetNameDef], of course, as much is yet to be accomplished. However, the future is hopefully with the ascension of Sultan Ahmed IV to the throne.\n\nCertainly an interesting figure, the new Sultan has promised the institution of new reforms in order to slowly, yet surely, liberalize the empire and allow for the freedom of all peoples alongside ridding [Root.GetNameDef] of the moniker, ‘The Sick Man of Europe’. While this will undoubtably be a tough challenge, the Sultan feels as though he is up to the task."
trt.8.revanchist:0 "Thankfully, we have managed to stand firm against any sort of opposition that may have sought to dissolve the empire and potentially destabilize our great nation. This does not mean all is right within [Root.GetNameDef], of course, as much is yet to be accomplished. However, the future is hopefully with the ascension of Sultan Osman IV to the throne.\n\nCertainly an interesting figure, the new Sultan has promised the institution of new reforms in order to slowly, yet surely, strengthen the empire and allow for the glorification of all peoples alongside ridding [Root.GetNameDef] of the moniker, ‘The Sick Man of Europe’. While this will undoubtably be a tough challenge, the Sultan feels as though he is up to the task."
trt.8.a:0 "A light at the end of the tunnel..."

trt.9.t:0 "A New Constitution"
trt.9.moderateconstitution:0 "It is clear that our empire, or what remains of it, is a decadent nation, still carrying the baggage that has plagued it for centuries on end. If we wish to bring an end to our problems and truly usher in the era of unity, stability, and prosperity for [Root.GetNameDef], we must begin to write a new constitution.\n\nThe constitution itself now vests a majority of the power in the parliament, taking it away from the Sultan and the Grand Vizier, allowing for a fairer, more representative nation. In addition, the judiciary is now an independent branch, allowing for more just trials of the people. Hopefully, this will help our empire flourish."
trt.9.revanchistconstitution:0 "It is clear that our empire, or what remains of it, is a decadent nation, still carrying the baggage that has plagued it for centuries on end. If we wish to bring an end to our problems and truly usher in the era of unity, stability, and prosperity for [Root.GetNameDef], we must begin to write a new constitution.\n\nThe constitution itself now vests a majority of the power in the Sultan and the Grand Vizier, taking it away from The General Assembly, allowing for a nation with a benevolent and guiding hand. The Sultan has also taken steps to ensure that the rest of the government is under his will so that he can better help dictate the policies of the empire. Hopefully, this will help our empire flourish."
trt.9.a:0 "Wonderful!"

trt.10.t:0 "Dealing With the Bureaucracy"
trt.10.d:0 "One of the biggest and most outstanding problems within [Root.GetNameDef], the bureaucratic system of our empire has been a thorn in the side of any competent ruler who has sought to modernize and bring about change within the nation.\n\nHowever, with the rule of the Sultan now firmly entrenched, and the people now accustomed to the new political realities facing them, it is time that we finally begin to undertake the monumental task of dealing with the sluggish and inefficient bureaucratic system which has plagued our empire for far too long.\n\nBy instituting a series of reforms designed to make the bureaucratic system easier to deal with and more efficient, for both bureaucrats and common citizens, alongside hiring both competent and loyal bureaucrats, we can finally make headway towards establishing [Root.GetNameDef] as a state that is on par with its European brethren."
trt.10.a:0 "Let's just hope this works..."

trt.11.t:0 "Our Efforts Have Been Successful!"
trt.11.d:0 "Months have gone by, with the Sultan and the government ensuring that the reforms, aimed at modernizing our bureaucracy, are followed to a T. Thankfully, it seems as though, through a combination of keeping on top of the bureaucrats while also implementing effective reforms, [Root.GetNameDef] has become a more bureaucratically efficient state. This has allowed for not only more qualified bureaucrats to step up and take positions within the government, but for common citizens to more easily handle their day to day affairs in relation to the government. The reforms certainly have shown and have made [Root.GetNameDef] a better nation.\n\nIn addition, this has come to a shock to international observers, who were, at first, skeptical of our reformation efforts. They too have begun to see the effectiveness of the reforms implemented by [Root.GetLeader]."
trt.11.a:0 "This is wonderful!"

trt.12.t:0 "Reformation of the Banking System"
trt.12.d:0 "By working towards empowering the Ottoman Central Bank and the Ottoman Stock Exchange, which have not seen much economic activity in the past few years, we can better regulate finance within our nation while also stimulating economic activity and helping ensure the stability of our currency while also turning our gaze on becoming a more financially sound nation. That way, we can make sure that all of our citizens prosper alongside the state itself."
trt.12.a:0 "This is a necessary measure."

trt.13.t:0 "The Status of the Monarchy"
trt.13.d:0 "As we have become more and more entrenched in our position of ruling the empire and have also slowly, yet surely, restored the confidence of the people in the Sultanate, we can now finally take the great leap of faith forward and truly begin to liberalize the empire.\n\nSultan Ahmed IV has announced his decision to limit the power of the House of Osman in order to empower the three branches of government and allow for a freer and better run Ottoman Empire. This news come as a shock to nobody, as the Sultan had made clear that he would make the Sultanate a more impartial voice in politics alongside empowering the common people and allowing for representation. How well this system will work, however, is yet to be seen..."
trt.13.a:0 "This is, surely, a momentous occasion."

trt.14.t:0 "Judicial Fairness"
trt.14.d:0 "It is clear to many that the reforms during the late nineteenth century were not enough to fully ensure judicial fairness. We must make sure that the reforms which had been previously brought about, such as the continued creation and use of Mecelle alongside fair/public trials for our citizens, are properly enforced in order to give every citizen of the empire a chance to speak out and an opportunity for freedom. In addition, this will help us further close the gap between ourselves and the rest of the European powers."
trt.14.a:0 "This shall be a great boon to our efforts."

trt.15.t:0 "Ending Corruption"
trt.15.d:0 "While we have managed to institute and enforce sweeping reforms, such as the reorganization of our once decadent bureaucracy, a proper multi-party system, and the more recent reformation of the judicial system, we still have yet to deal with the rampant corruption within the empire. Efforts to curtail this blatant act of, what some may consider, treason against the empire must be made. Anti-corruption laws and measures shall be passed, and we shall work with the Emniyet-i Umumiye in order to make sure that arrests are made against officials who are caught breaching the law."
trt.15.a:0 "We must stand firm."

trt.16.t:0 "Constantinople Remilitarized"
trt.16.d:0 "With radicals successfully seizing power in the Turkish state to our east, it seems as though we must begin to take action as they have begun the remilitarization of Constantinople. This will definitely pose a threat to us if we do not handle the situation soon. We could launch a pre-emptive attack or, alternatively, send a plea to Britain to help us. Then again, it may be too soon to attack."
trt.16.a:0 "We must put down the Turkish menace!"
trt.16.b:0 "We are not yet ready for war..."
trt.16.c:0 "Call in the British."

trt.17.t:0 "Remilitarzation of Istanbul" 
trt.17.d:0 "One of the first items on the list of our great leader was the remilitarization of Istanbul, which had been demilitarized by the Entente following the conclusion the Great War and our humiliating defeat. The reason behind the demilitarization itself was, as stated by the government, an attempt to ‘right the wrongs’ of the Great War and restore our nation to its former glory."
trt.17.a:0 "It is, after all, our rightful territory."
 
trt.18.t:0 "Request from Greece"
trt.18.d:0 "With the recent remilitarzation of Constantinople, Greece has been worried of the increased Turkish threat beyond their borders and have come to us for help. What shall we do?"
trt.18.a:0 "Help them, of course."
trt.18.b:0 "We cannot risk yet another war..."
 
trt.19.t:0 "Britain refuses"
trt.19.d:0 "Britain has refused our plea for help against the Turkish menace. It seems we are on our own."
trt.19.a:0 "Dammit!"

trt.20.t:0 "Overhauling the Political System"
trt.20.d:0 "By constricting the parties that are in direct opposition, whether explicitly or implicitly, to our goals, we can ensure that parliamentary representatives that are elected are more favourable towards what we consider to be optimal. This will mean that a lot of the republican and left leaning parties will lose representation and the Sultan will manage to, slowly but surely, take the reins through the manipulation of the existing system."
trt.20.a:0 "Excellent."

trt.21.t:0 "Judicial Control"
trt.21.d:0 "The Sultan has decided to step in and reverse many of the reforms that had been made to the judicial system during the late nineteenth century. Non-Muslims shall no longer enjoy the freedoms they once had, and trials shall now favour the people we consider true Ottomans. In addition, the Sultan shall be given more power to freely enforce Kanuns and his word will be considered final by all. We cannot hope to leave the judicial system in the hands of corrupt or inefficient judges if we are to truly save the empire."
trt.21.a:0 "Power has been consolidated."

trt.22.t:0 "A New Grand Vizier"
trt.22.d:0 "We must look towards appointing the a loyal Grand Vizier as a way to help provide more legitimacy to our rule whilst also making it appear to the masses as though the Sultan does not have absolute power when, in fact, he does. In what is considered as a smart, yet somewhat risky, move by observers at home and abroad, Sultan Osman IV has decided to appoint Mustafa Fevzi Paşa as the new Grand Vizier. Once the Minister of War for [Root.GetNameDef], Mustafa Fevzi Paşa’s expertise in matters of war will certainly help with overseeing the development of a mobilized and active Ottoman state, ready to take action against all who have wronged it."
trt.22.a:0 "Hopefully we've made the correct choice."

trt.23.t:0 "Disbanding Parliament"
trt.23.d:0 "It is clear that parliament is an archaic relic and nothing more than a sham that stands in the way of not only the wishes of the Sultan, but the wishes of the people. We cannot allow such an institution, which hurts not only our state but our way of life, to continue and must look towards its immediate removal.\n\nOf course, this will not endear us to our political opposition, who may now look towards doing all that they can to stop our initiative. In addition, the opposition within the country itself is already having a hard time digesting our current reforms, so this could lead them to do unspeakable things. For now, we must keep watch..."
trt.23.a:0 "Onwards!"
trt.23.b:0 "Crush the opposition at once!"

trt.24.t:0 "Revolution Has Broken Out!"
trt.24.d:0 "We’ve just received disastrous news! Apparently, our political opposition has taken matters into their own hands, mobilizing the general population against us! The Turanists, Liberals, and Kemalists have managed to overcome their differences and have forged a coalition against us, vowing to take us out, declaring themselves the true heirs of the empire. We cannot allow them to tarnish the name of our great empire in such a manner and we must take decisive action as soon as possible."
trt.24.a:0 "God help us."

trt.25.t:0 "A New Alphabet"
trt.25.d:0 "One of the proposed reforms of the Kemalists was the institution of a new alphabet. Their plan is to do away with the old Ottoman script, which they consider archaic and foreign, and adopt the Latin script, thereby westernizing the alphabet. In addition, the ‘Turkification’ and removal of various Arabian and Persian loan words shall commence as soon as possible.\n\nOn top of all this, however, the Kemalists have now passed the Surname Law, which will force all citizens of [Root.GetNameDef] to adopt a surname and abolishing the titles during the time of the Ottoman Empire."
trt.25.a:0 "Hurrah!"

trt.26.t:0 "Banning the Fez?"
trt.26.d:0 "A hot topic between the members of the General National Assembly was banning the fez. While the Kemalists are all in favour of banning the fez (and other religiously affiliated headgear), they face much opposition from traditionalists and clerics within the nation. While banning the fez could help modernization efforts, it risks angering a substantial portion of the population."
trt.26.a:0 "We must modernize, no matter what."
trt.26.b:0 "On second thought, this isn't that important..."

trt.27.t:0 "Status of our Legal Code"
trt.27.d:0 "The old Ottoman legal code was one that was extremely confusing, due to incorporating secular and religious law, and, oftentimes, favoured the Muslim majority within the nation. The Kemalists want to do away with what they consider to be an old and outdated legal code and institute a secular law structure based off of the Swiss Civil Code. This has garnered the support of many people, who wish to see a fairer system in place but risks angering traditionalists and members of the clergy."
trt.27.a:0 "We must institute a fairer system."
trt.27.b:0 "The current system is fine."

trt.28.t:0 "The Gregorian Calendar?"
trt.28.d:0 "The Kemalists wish to do away with the Rumi calendar, which begins on 622 AD (the year of Muhammad’s emigration), and institute the more widely used and western Gregorian calendar. This is not very popular with the public as they see the reform itself as too minute to make a difference, while the traditionalists are not in favour of the adoption of what they consider to be a western calendar. What should we do?"
trt.28.a:0 "We must go ahead."
trt.28.b:0 "Maybe this isn't such a good idea..."

trt.29.t:0 "The Question of Women's Rights"
trt.29.d:0 "Society within the Ottoman Empire was known to be very tradition and women had next to no political rights. By advancing the idea of women’s rights, we can allow for better representation within our country (by enacting universal suffrage and equality laws) and help further productivity and equal participation within Turkish society. Of course, this will not endear us to many of the more traditional members of our society. What shall we do?"
trt.29.a:0 "They deserve equal rights."
trt.29.b:0 "This is too risky an undertaking."

trt.30.t:0 "The Second Great War"
trt.30.d:0 "Once again, the fires of war have burst out in Europe, enveloping the continent in a brutal hellfire similar to the one that broke out less than 20 years ago. Not long ago the German regime has taken it upon themselves to 'right the wrongs' of the Great War and create a New Germany that would strech from the Meuse to the Neman once more. Surprisingly, the Germans are looking to be a very formidible enemy for the Entente as France and Italy are having difficulty in putting them down. Perhaps we can be the weight that tips the scales in this new war, and we have no doubt that Germany would accept an offer for an alliance given their position."
trt.30.a:0 "Ask the Germans if we can join the Stahlpakt!"
trt.30.b:0 "We have no interest in siding with the Germans."

trt.31.d:0 "In a surprising move, the former terminally ill man of Europe has sent a request to join the Stahlpakt. Following the Great War, the Ottoman Empire was partitioned in a much more brutal fashion than the German Empire. Italy took Panfilia coupled with France taking portions of Syria, Lebanon and Hantab which would lead to the creation of Phoenicia. \n\n The Ottomans sit in a strategically valuable area in the Middle-east, having them as an ally would certainly inconvenience the French and Italians substantially... But then again, they were by no means a viable ally in the Great War."

Agreeing as our nations have formed Brotherly-ties in the Great War, Adam Dressler has vowed to see ALL of the victims of versailles restored to their former greatness. With a new German-Turkish axis formed, a real empire ruled by Turks seems closer now than it did in the closing years of the Great War. \n Trade Routes have been planned, Turkish and German Military Staff are now undertaking meetings, and prominent German and Turkish political leaders are making visits to eachother; our bonds with Germany seem to be stronger than steel."

trt.33.d:0 "The Germans seem to have rejected our gracious offer! With judgement awful as that it is no wonder they managed to lose us the Great War! The mindless dictator known as 'Adam Dressler' has cited that we were a minimally useful Ally in the Great War and were likely to be even worse considering how brutally partitioned we were in the Conferences of Versailles. We have managed to refrain from mentioning that Germany herself was incredibly humiliated in the Versailles Accord, but the problem stands. We have been locked out of the Stahlpakt and our lands still lie in the hands of the French and Italians. What shall we do?"

Unfortunately for the Italians, they have lost a war without being able to switch sides in time. The mainland Italian Peninsula is firmly in German Control, and we have ample opportunity to retake our rightful lands with the Italian government scrambling to assemble themselves in Africa. This is arguably the best opportunity we could have to seize Panfilia and restore them to Turkist rule."

trt.37.d:0 "The godless Turks have occupied chunks of northern Syria! Given our status as an exiled nation, they have gambled by assuming we would not resist an occupation of colonial territories. Little do those Vultures know, we could very well resist an invasion of northern syria, however doing so would require us to delegate military resources to a non-vital front. It might be in our best interests to let this slide and deal with the Turks once we retake the homeland."

Corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency were widespread in the former empire and considered commonplace or were not properly dealt with. This has, unfortunately, carried on into [Root.GetNameDef]. We must take steps to ensure that officials hired are both effective at their job and willing to work for the interests of not themselves, but the state. In addition, the Turkish Public Administration has been founded to replace the old Ottoman bureaucracy. Hopefully, a fresh start is what will help our endeavours."

While this is, by no means, a good thing, it is clear that there is hope for [Root.GetNameDef] and its people. Because while the traditionalists and clergymen have managed to defeat us at present, there were certain groups of people who were receptive towards our reforms and wish to see the Republic as a secular, modern, and westernized state..."

trt.42.t:0 "Decentralized Rule"
trt.42.d:0 "By deferring to the local governments and ridding the administrative system of its centralized nature, we can help ensure better representation for the people and, consequently, assure a true democratic state. This also assists us in our endeavour of making the administrative and bureaucratic systems themselves more efficient, as the local governments shall no longer have to follow directives from the national government in Constantinople. No longer shall the demands of the people be ignored nor shall our administration constrict the local governments themselves."

But the Armenian government has refused the cession of this territory. The order was given from Istanbul for the army to begin an invasion."
