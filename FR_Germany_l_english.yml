The German Empire quickly called for armistice. The strategy used to achieve this quick and overwhelming victory has since been called 'Lynkrig' or 'Lightning War' by historians. Sitting as victors at the Paris Peace Conference, we were awarded back our territories of Schleswig and Holstein but now it seems 'Valkist' Germany is demanding that we give the German people in these regions the right to decide which nation they should belong to through a referendum. Unlike in 1919 our armed forces have been severely ignored so we can't simply disregard this request and risk going to war but it would also be a great insult against our nation to allow Germany to pick us apart.

ger.168.d:0 "[GER.GetLeader] has died. His rule has defined Germany for nearly the last decade. In the aftermath of the Great War, Germany was crippled by the victorious Entente powers and the history of Europe changed forever. The old Germany had died in the conflict and out of it's ashes a new vision for the German people arose. [GER.GetLeader]'s political philosophy and reforms lead Germany to reemerge as the predominant power of Europe. As The 2nd Great War expanded across the continent, the German army was able to easily overwhelm the Entente and avenge the injustices made at Versailles. \n\n1942 opens with our nation dominating the world stage. The German people finally belong to a nation to be proud of but not all is good within Berlin. At a meeting with the 'Großer Rat', [GER.GetLeader] collapsed into a stroke. He was quickly rushed to a nearby hospital where he failed to regain consciousnesses and died a few hours later. An X-ray scan showed a small piece of shrapnel, an injury caused by a French artillery attack during the 1st Great War, had finally pierced an artery in his brain leading to a fatal hemorrhage. News of his death was kept secret for many days as not to ruin the moral of the German people during these challenging times but for our government to continue we must choose who should succeed [GER.GetLeader] and his legacy. \n\nThis will no be an easy decision as many factions fight for control due to the massive power vacuum created by [GER.GetLeader]'s untimely death. For many within the inner circle of the Valkist party it seems that Anton Arco-Valley, the right hand man of [GER.GetLeader], should be the next Führer. The TST, The ever growing German paramilitary group lead by the eccentric Rudolf von Sebottendorf, has gained significant influence on the policies of Germany due to their role in the war effort. Some fear that he may initiate a putsch and install himself as Führer. With the death of the [GER.GetLeader] much of the unity within the party has been lost. Infighting and debate on the future of Germany has broken out. Hermann Goring has started a faction who believe that the war has met all it's goals and wish to see the conflict come to a close. Goring and many others want to focus on building Großdeutschland into the sole world power [GER.GetLeader] had originally envisioned. The fate of Germany and the world may rest upon what transpires these next few days."
ger.169.d:0 "The Summer games have begun. Athletes from all over the world have met in Berlin to compete for glory. German chancellor, [GER.GetLeader] has spared no expense showcasing the beauty and power of his nation. Adolf Hitler, the favorite architect of [GER.GetLeader], has designed lavish public works within and around Berlin including the magnificent Reichssportfeld stadium. The competitions this year might be the most exciting yet as nations from all over the globe battle for the most medals"
ger.170.d:0 "After 2 weeks of stiff competition the 1936 summer games have concluded. While many nations took home medals the United States and Germany won the most. At the closing ceremony [GER.GetLeader] used the victory of the German athletes to proclaim the superiority of the 'New German' a man free from the constraints of traditional Christian morals and who could lead his life as he saw fit. Despite the cheers from the crowd those from the nations which surround Germany have taken this to be a foreboding statement"
ger.172.d:0 "Since it's construction in the 14th century Notre Dame has stood as one of Europe's most awe inspiring religious halls. A group of young Valkists have petitioned our government to allow them to practice there ritual within the church. The Nordic inspired group wishes to practice traditional German religion and hope to use this to help spread their movement. While this could help spread Germanic influence among the Valkist's living in Paris we may want to be cautious about upsetting the more conservative members of Parisian society and government."
ger.175.d:0 "Beginning it's circumnavigation of the globe the Zeppelin Tanngrisnir takes off at an airfield outside of Berlin. The path of the airship will have it land in the most prestigious nations on Earth. It's first stop will be England where it is rumored that Edward VIII will be in attendance to see Tanngrisnir land. Following this the ship will stop in France, cross the Atlantic to New York, refuel in San Diego, Cross the pacific towards Japan, breifly stop in India and finally make it's last showing outside of Instanbul. A ship it's size and power will diplay the clear supremacy of Valkism to the international community."
ger.190.d:0 "Disputes between Otto Strasser and [GER.GetLeader] have been growing for years now. Stasser's anti-capitalist views have gathered the negative attention of many Valkists officials and have even earned him accusations of holding Socialist sympathies. [GER.GetLeader]'s recent appointment of his personal architect Adolf Hitler to the post of Economic Ministers effectively pushed Strasser our of German politics. As a result of this Strasser has fled to Danish controlled Holstein to support its fledgling Collectivist movement. This turn of events is has been a national embarrassment for the Valkist party and only serves to give ammo for [GER.GetLeader]'s detractors."
ger.192.d:0 "After the Great War France and the other Entente powers establish themselves as the overseers and protectors of Europe. To accomplish this goal France established the Entente Council as an organization to mediate any conflicts that arise on the continent. Every year delegates from all across Europe gather in Paris for 2 weeks of discussion and debate. This year is shaping up to be the most important Council yet. The economic depression caused by the London Stock Market Collapse is forcing nations to scramble for solutions and the threat of German rearmament looms over us more and more. The continued stability of Europe may rest on the outcome of this council."
ger.193.d:0 "Now that delegates have rived from all across Europe we can begin discussions. Many issues will need to be discussed by the end of this council. We must establish how to deal with Germany's complete disregard of the Versailles Treaty, an action that must not go unchecked. We must also touch upon the recent economic depression that is sweeping through Europe. For a quick recovery we must agree on a unified strategy. The final issue that has been suggested for discussion is the diplomatic status of the Soviet Union. in 1917 our ally, the Russian Empire, fell into a brutal civil war in which the liberal democratic White forces were pitted against the Collectivist Red forces. By 1922 most of the White force was defeated and many of there leaders immigrated to Paris. In an act of solidarity the Entente has refused to recognize the USSR as the legitimate Russian state but without British support and the rising threat of Germany it may be time to set aside our ideological pride and focus on pragmatic needs. To send a strong message to the German Reich we must be on good terms with the powerful Soviet Union."
ger.194.d:0 "When [GER.GetLeader] took power in Germany he promised his supporters that he would restore the Reich's former glory. It is clear now that he is willing to do this at any cost. When the London Stock Market Crash swept through France and Europe, [GER.GetLeader] took the opportunity to announce that Germany would no longer abide to the Treaty of Versailles. As our delegates speak the German war machine that lead to the deaths of over 20 million people during the Great War roars back to life. \n\n It has been agreed early on that France and the greater European community are in no shape to disarm Germany by force but if we take action now we may be able to cripple [GER.GetLeader]'s goal of rearmament. Germany is incredible dependent on it's neighbors for it's industrial sector. If we can agree on proper weapon sanctions we could bring Germany's arms industry to a halt but many delegates worry that hurting there own arms industry in the middle of a recession isn't worth the small diplomatic foot hold over Germany."
ger.195.d:0 "After hours of arguing a final vote on the German issue has been reached. Proponents believe that sanctioning the German arms industry will cripple Germany's ability to wage an offensive war but opponents believe that this would only damage there nation's own arms industry which relies on German income to survive."
ger.196.d:0 "After hours of debates the Entente Council voted against sanctioning Germany. Fears that this action would hurt there own arms industry ran rampant through the delegates chamber. France will now have to find her own ways of dealing with Germany."
ger.197.d:0 "After hours of debate the Entente Council has voted to sanction Germany. Most delegates were swayed by the hope that sanctioning the German arms industry would destroy there plans for rearmament. Only time will tell if this proves true."
ger.198.d:0 "The cowardly French have pressured a horde of nations to sanction our country in attempt to damage our arms industry. The Entente and their allies will no longer sell arms and weapon manufacturing equipment to our nation. Despite French hopes though this will only be a small road block in the way towards our goal of a German dominated Europe."
ger.199.d:0 "The London Stock Market Crash has caused what may be the greatest economic recces ion to ever effect Europe. Unemployment sores as companies and businesses are no longer able to keep there doors open. France has drafted an economic recovery plan to asst Europe through this disaster. In it our nation would be obligated to increase taxes on high earners and use the profits to subsidies currently operational business. In addition to this we would also need to keep exporting resources to Entente Council members that require them in an attempt to keep there industry operating. The hope is that these policies will prevent any further bankruptcies and stop the rapid unemployment. Many delegates worry that these policies are too rigid and don't take into account the specific needs that each individual nation may have."
ger.200.d:0 "After hours of arguments a final vote on how to approach the economic recovery has been made. Proponents argue that economic cooperation and austerity policies will be needed to overcome the recession while opponents argue that the French economic recovery plan is is too rigid and fails to address the specific needs of individual nations."

Though it may be in our interests to maintain positive relations with the Poles, officers within the military believe that maintaining a military occupation of Lemko and eventually installing a loyal regime would serve our expansionist aims better. Poland is a targeted nation with enemies on all side but a possible ally against the Soviet menace."
ger.10175.d:0 "Despite our support against Bohemia, Germany has chosen to occupy the previously promised territory of Lemko. After a short series of battles German forces pushed our army back behind the pre-war border. This whole campaign has been a national embarrassment leaving our once proud nation a weakened pariah within the greater European community."
ger.1018.d:0 "As tensions rise in Europe once again it is paramount to find strong allies. The German Reich has offered to send us advisors to overlook the development of our industry and army. We are surrounded by the extreme ideology of Socialism, Norway to the west and the Soviets to the east. If we wish to survive against the tide of revolution we must take all the support we can get. Many of the more moderate officials within the Swedish government warn that [GER.GetLeader]'s Valkism is just another face of socialism and that we should seek the support of the more established and reasonable democracies of western Europe."
ger.1019.d:0 "Our diplomatic venture to Sweden has ended in success. They have accepted our ministers and as such our relationship steadily grows."
ger.1020.d:0 "The Swedes have turned back our ministers, claiming that they have no desire to receive support from a regime like ours. We approached them with open arms and support for their sovereignty but it seems they would rather risk becoming another SSR within Moscow's sphere."
ger.1021.d:0 "Our war with Norway has attracted the attention of many anti-Socialists within Europe. Hundreds of German nationalists have crossed the Baltic to volunteer for our cause. They are incredible dedicated to defeating Norwegian Socialism and seemingly loyal to Sweden. We must get them in the field as soon as possible"
ger.1022.d:0 "After weeks of planning Otto Skorzeny is prepared to infiltrate the Norwegian capital of Oslo. He and his team will travel by U-boat, avoiding shipping lanes and land on the outskirts of the city in the early morning under the cover of darkness. From there he will enter the city and plant explosive charges on several industrial targets. If this plan is a success it will severely weaken the Norwegian capability to wage war against Sweden."
ger.1023.d:0 "Diligent planning and excellent initiative has resulted in Skorzeny successfully completing his raid on Oslo. Though his team infiltrated the city without issue they soon raised the suspicion of local authorities. Skorzeny's poor skill in the Norwegian language and obvious Austrian accent did not help matters but nevertheless he and his team decided to proceed. Taking a safer but slower route to their objective, the team was able to avoid any further detection and planted explosives on some of the designated factories before sunrise forced them to retreat prematurely. Though not to the scale originally planned, this operation was still a success."
ger.1024.d:0 "Poor planning and lack of talented leadership has resulted in Skorzeny being apprehended by Norwegian Authorities. Troubles plagued the operation from the beginning. The U-Boat used to transport the men landed well within sight of the Norwegian Coast Guard forcing the men to scatter into the local forest instead of the designated rendezvous point. A couple hours were then spent regrouping, losing precious time for the operation. When the group was finally able to attempt infiltrating Oslo local authorities, who were already on alert from previous spottings, interrogated the strange, out of place men walking their streets. When questioned by police, Otto Skorzeny's atrocious attempt at Norwegian cleared any doubt of his team's true nationality. Our government has denied any connection to Skorzeny's actions but few are convinced. Otto Skorzeny's failure has been a huge embarrassment for our nation."
ger.1025.d:0 "In the night hours of the early morning a factory producing arms for the war effort against Sweden suffered from a catastrophic explosion that has left 29 workers either dead or injured. Originally thought to be caused improperly produced artillery shells, further investigation points to intentional sabotage from and foreign source. More investigation will be needed before a solid culprit can be identified but in the mean time this has been a major set back for our war effort."
ger.1026.d:0 "Earlier this morning a German U-Boat was spotted near the waters of Oslo. The ship dived before our navy could investigate but supplies left on a near by beach suggested that a contingent of soldiers may have been left behind. With this knowledge we put the police on Oslo on heightened alert. A couple hours later a confused group of men were spotted walking the streets. When approached by the police they acted nervous and attempted to inform us that they were in a hurry to get back home, or so we think. Their thick German accents made it hard to understand. The group was then taken into police custody for further questioning. It's clear that these men are German agents but both them and the German government remain silent ad to there purpose. A trial is soon to be set for the men, where a court will certainly find them guilty of crimes against our state."
ger.1028.d:0 "Germany has recently approached our nation with a proposal to sell us arms at a massively reduced price. Reforms to the German army has made this equipment obsolete for them but we may be able to find uses for these weapons. The Anti-Polish faction within our government supports increase cooperation with Germany but most within the more conservative factions see Germany as a threat to our sovereignty. We have a need to modernize our army but we must be wary of German influence or appearing treasonous to the Poles."
ger.1029.d:0 "Our generous offer to the Lithuanians has be rejected by their foreign minister. We may have to rethink our plans of playing the Lithuanians off the Poles. The blind government in Kaunas would rather remain Polish slaves than have a taste of freedom."
ger.1030.d:0 "Lithuania has accepted our erogenous offer for an arms sale. Right now hundreds of shipments of German equipment cross the border into Lithuania. This will hopefully help the Baltic state fight off Polish authority and" solidify our relationship for future German-Lithuanian cooperation."
ger.1031.d:0 "Germany's intelligence agency has revealed to us documents claiming to show a Polish military build up on our border. If these documents are true it is clear that Warsaw is planning a swift takeover of our homeland. If we choose to heed Germany's advice we must act quickly and disarm all Polish brigades within in our territory and prepare our army to defend against any intrusions though our border. Despite the possible risks many within our own intelligence circle doubt the validity of the German papers. There information is vague and supporting evidence is lacking. While Germany may not be the most trust worthy nation we should not let personal squabbles distract from the real threat."
ger.10311.d:0 "Despite our evidence to the contrary, Lithuania refuses to believe that Poland has any intention to reduce their autonomy. They have expelled our intelligence ministers and have made it clear that they seek no further cooperation with our nation."
ger.1032.d:0 "Germany has sent our government an ultimatum. In it they demand the return of our western territories that our home to large German populations. After the Great War most Germans left these regions when our government took over but this still has not dissuaded The German Fuhrer, [GER.GetLeader], who claims that these territories are part of 'Großdeutschland' or 'Greater Germany'. On top of there demand for territory, they also stipulate that we install pro-German ministers into several important government positions and that Germany will have complete control over our foreign policy. \n\nThis is a clear assault on our sovereignty. We must get the French to support us in this cause and help us fight back if the situation leads to that. Our military staff on the other hand warns that any armed conflict with Germany will almost certainly end in defeat and even if the French agree to support us, German dominance over the Baltic will keep any supplies or men from reaching us. \n\nThe deadline approaches ever closer. We must make a decision."
ger.1033.d:0 "In a unsuspected turn of events the Poles have agreed to our ultimatum. Currently Polish forces are withdrawing from their former western positions and our army is moving in to assume control. The dream of a united Germany now marches closer to our grasp and with most of eastern Europe in our sphere of influence can begin preparations for our crusade against the Collectivist Russian state."
ger.1034.d:0 "Our ultimatum has passed and the Poles still refuse to relinquish South Prussia and Posnan. It is clear that this crisis can only be solved with bullets and men. Our armies are stationed on the Polish border and are posed to strike. Give your word and our armies will crush Poland."
ger.1035.d:0 "Germany has offered to send military officers and equipment to help us modernize our army against the Soviet threat. In a recent speech German Fuhrer, [GER.GetLeader], has stated that 'Poland is the front line protecting the civilizations of Europe from the vile philosophy. of Collectivism. There brave victories against the Soviet Union should be an inspiration for all citizens. of Germany.' Kind words for sure but the German people have never been trust worthy friends of Poland so we should be incredibly wary of any German support."
ger.1036.d:0 "Poland has accepted our offer. With the growing threat of the Soviet Union the Polish military staff has accepted the need for more international cooperation and military expansion. Hopefully this is the just the beginning of cooperation against Russia."
ger.1037.d:0 "Poland has rejected any support from us. The Polish foreign office even claims that 'Valkism is just another face of Collectivism'. Attempting to work with Poland was nothing short of foolish. We will now have to find different allies to stand up to the threat of Russia."
ger.1038.d:0 "German diplomats have come to our government to request a formal alliance between our nations. This would give a strong protection against the Soviet Union and give us easier access to German ports on the Baltic, decreasing export and import costs. While these positives stand out the wording of the German document is vague enough to require that our nation support German wars in western Europe. This scenario would be disastrous for our nation but protection against Collectivism may make this deal too important to refuse."
ger.1039.d:0 "Poland refuses to formalize any alliance with our nation. They'd rather keep good relations with the cowardly French even if they risk the future of their country."
ger.1040.d:0 "The German Reich has offered us a protective alliance against the Soviet Union. During the Russian Civil War we captured the Russian territory of Besarabia which has been claimed by the Ukrainian SSR ever since. For protection of our sovereignty we may have to accept a German alliance. Both France and Britain are too far to provide serious protection,"
ger.1041.d:0 "Romanian officials reject our proposed alliance. Despite the increasing threat of the Soviet Union the Romanians prefer to stay on good terms with the backstabbing French. While it is obvious to us that the French are too far away to provide them assistance, this information has seemingly alluded the Romanian government. We will have to look for other allies in our crusade against Collectivism."
ger.1042.d:0 "Germany has offered to sell us military equipment and manufacturing tools at a reduced price. This will help supply up our armed forces but the flood of German equipment may deinsentivise Polish owned companies from investing in further research and development. Your cabinet warns that this may help our armed forces in the short term but long term dependence on Germany may weaken our nation permanently."
ger.1043.d:0 "Poland has accepted our trade proposal. Despite objections from some within the military staff, This deal will bring funds into Germany and hopefully force the Polish state to become dependent on us for support. A true win win situation."
ger.1044.d:0 "Poland has refused our generous trade proposal. Despite the backwards state of their army the Polish military still insist that they are better on their own without outside interference. If Poland chooses to paint itself a target for the Soviets there is not much we can do."
ger.1046.d:0 "Our ports are the lifeline for both Lithuania and Poland but under Russian rule they fell into disuse. Today they still remain underdeveloped which has hurt our economic development. Germany has approached us with a deal to develop these ports. This would help increase our access to the Atlantic but our economic advisors warn us that under these provision the ports would be majority owned by German investors who would certainly put the foreign policy goals of Germany over the needs of Lithuanians. Global trade is the mark of great nations but Germany's ambitions may cause our home more harm than it's worth."
ger.1047.d:0 "Lithuania has agreed to allow Germany to develop there Baltic ports. Our agreement will give German shipping company Norddeutscher Lloyd a majority stake in these new dockyards, giving Germany major influence over Lithuania. Slowly the Baltic will rightfully be in Germany's sphere of influence."

After securing most of Vienna the Putschists were trying to march onto the Austrian Parliament, where the Austrian Government under Dollfuß was currently holding a conference, were caught in a firefight with Members of the Austrian Police and loyal soldiers of the Austrian Army, which with reinforcements coming in from St. Pölten was able to repel the Putschists and disperse them.

Officers within the Armée de l'Air believe that we can quickly achieve a crippling blow against Germany be destroying the dam through a decisive bombing strike. The pilots will leave early morning and use the cover of darkness to avoid detection while they fly over Austrian territory. The operation will be costly and with all night missions, very difficult but if we can achieve this objective we will gain an advantage over Germany we severely need."
ger.1068.d:0 "In the early morning hours unidentified planes were spotted flying over western Austria. They were quickly identified as French air craft and their objective was determined to be our glorious Danube Dam. We have scrambled our nearest plains to intercept but the French have caught our air force off guard and unprepared. The fate of nearly all industry in Austria rest in the hands of our brave German pilots."
ger.1069.d:0 "The French strike on our territory was unfortunately successful. Despite the bravery of our pilots they were unable to overcome there French adversaries. The Danube dam lies in ruins. It will take millions of Reichsmarks and months of work in the best of conditions to make it operational again. With our war with the French in full swing we cannot currently divert any material for this repair task. For the immediate future the pinnacle of German engineering will remain in ruins."
ger.1070.d:0 "Despite being caught off guard we have overcome the French attack. There few remaining pilots fly desperately back to France, too afraid to fight like real men. The courageous German pilots that made this victory possible will be welcomed home as heros of the Reich. Men like these show once again the dominance that both Valkism and Germany have over Europe."
ger.1071.d:0 "Despite our thorough planing and training our pilots were unable to complete their objectives in Austria. We underestimated the size of the German force in the area which quickly lead to the French strike team becoming overwhelmed.

Thanks to the swiftness and surprise of our attacks the Germans had no chance to scramble many plans to intercept our own.

Named after the one of the goats who pulled Odin's chariot in Norse mythology, the Tanngrisnir is Germany's most advanced and impressive airship built to date. The vessel is prepared to commence long distance passenger flights within the following months but other uses have been suggested. \n\nBeing capable of intercontinental flights the ship would be capable of a circumnavigation in which we could share the glory a Valkism across the globe. On the other hand our military staff still see the possible military application of high altitude Zeppelins. When stationed at such heights Zeppelins are nearly undetectable from the ground. With this advantage we can easily spy undetected over enemy nations and scout out there air fields and garrisons giving us an advantage over the opposing force. Whatever we choose to use Tanngrisnir for, the vessel will remain an impressive achievement in aviation."

Local authorities had discovered that the corpse was at least several centuries old by the time our own experts arrived to assist in their research. Further examination of the 'Bocksten' man has shown that he was a most likely Christian priest who lived sometime around the 13th century, the tail end of the Christianisation of Scandinavia. Despite his holy position it seems that he had been murdered by the local people of medieval Sweden. In what we can only assume to be a final desperate attempt to save their pure Germanic culture from the corrupt claws of Christianity the Norse Swedes of the region beat the priest to death and finished him off with a stake through his heart. This ferocity and passion of these ancient Germanic people must be looked upon as an example to follow for all future Germans who wish to protect their culture and nation from foreign corruption."
ger.1082.d:0 "Germany is home to the greatest minds of the modern era. Our state has given these men and women the resources necessary to fulfill there endeavors. With rearmament though we must be cautious where we spend our Reichsmarks though. \n\n2 great minds have petitioned our government for monetary support for there projects. Kondrad Zuse, an engineer and mathematician, has pitched the idea of a calculating engine that would be capable of processing complicated math faster and more accurately then any human. Zuse has postulated many practical uses for this device such as calculating ballistic physics to improve the accuracy of our artillery or even the ability to mathematically encode our messages so they cant be decypherd by the enemy.\n\nThe other man of interest to consider is Kurt Diebner a physicist. The recent discovery of nuclear fission has inspired him to to consider the possible weponification of this phenomenon. When a nucleus is bombarded by neutrons it can split the nucleus, releasing a massive amount of energy. Better understanding and implementation of nuclear fission could lead us to create a new class of explosive completely incomparable to current designs. While promising even Diebner admits it will take years of work to even confirm if a weapon of this design is even feasible.\n\nBoth proposals show promise but with the military absorbing more and more of our national budget we must choose who to fund wisely."

ger.1053.a:0 "We must flee to Paris."
ger.1054.t:0 "The Valkists have been defeated."
ger.1054.d:0 "The unorganized Valkist mob has been defeated. Austrian police were able to easily deal with their attempted coup and now Valkists leaders are being rounded up for trials. Though little is concrete we have enough information to determine that Germany was clearly behind this attempted insurrection. Europe is no longer safe. We must take a side if we are to survive this century. The Entente will surely side with us against the German menace."
ger.1054.a:0 "The fate of our nation will be decided in Paris."
ger.10511.t:0 "Germany allows us to keep self government."
ger.10511.d:0 "In the wake of the Valkist coup it was expected that Germany would incorporate Austria directly into the greater Reich but a decree from the German chancellor, [GER.GetLeader], has allowed Austria to stay in control of it's own domestic affairs while all foreign policy will be dictated by Berlin. Germany will also have the right to appoint and remove any government official the see fit. While this has appeased some Austrian politicians, many are still vocal opponents of Germany."
ger.10511.a:0 "Germany really is our friend."
ger.400.t:0 "The Battle of France is lost"
ger.400.d:0 "The war with Germany has turned sharply against us. Unlike in the first Great War we were unable to keep the German hordes at bay. They broke though our lines, encircled our divisions, carved a path to Paris and occupied the city. Without our capital city and no hope of a counter attack to retake it we must accept defeat... for now. The Battle of France may be lost but the war will continue. Many of our generals and politicians are ready to establish a new base of operations in Algiers. From there we will be able to rebuild our strength far outside the reach of the pitiful German navy. Plans are already being set for the day we return to our homes as liberators but that path will be long and hard fought. For now all we can do is reorganize and prepare for future battles."

ger.401.t:0 "The French flee to Algiers"
ger.401.d:0 "France is ours! The government of France has collapsed. Their weak army was no match for ours and now they flee to Algiers. Only a few disorganized French divisions remain in Europe for us to clean up. As soon as we establish a friendly regime in Paris we will begin preparations for an invasion of North Africa. The French navy is still quite strong so we must plan thoroughly to overcome this. While the Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe fully support an invasion of Algiers many generals in the Wehrmacht believe that we should focus our military on easier targets in Europe. Our strength on land is proven, our Navy is not. For now though we have established ourselves as the greatest power in all of Europe. We must choose our direction carefully to keep this position."
ger.401.a:0 "Sieg Heil!"
ger.402.t:0 "Industrial equipment smuggled out of France."
ger.402.d:0 "Those who choose to flee France had to abandon many of their possessions. Very little heavy equipment was able to be brought to Algiers before the Valkist took over the mainland but a secret network of French partisans have been able to dismantle a large amount of industrial equipment from factories in southern France and are now ready to ship it Algiers for reassemble. This will greatly increase the output of local industry and will significantly improve our ability to wage a war against Germany."
ger.402.a:0 "The French spirit can not be broken!"
ger.403.t:0 "The fate of France"
ger.403.d:0 "Our victory over the French Republic has left us in control of nearly all of western Europe. 40 million non-Germans now live under our occupation and are certainly not accepting of it. Two plans have been drafted on how to deal with the unrest. We can establish a puppet regime in Paris lead by Valkist and head of the French Popular Party, Jacques Doriot. This nominal autonomy might calm down some of the unrest or at a minimum make it their issue instead of ours but many officers also believe that we should let our military directly keep a watch over the citizens of France and use any force necessary to keep them in line. While the second option would be expensive it could be more effective."

ger.4041.d:0 "A French partisan group, loyal to the Algiers regime, is suspected to be responsible for a bombing in one of our industrial complexes.

ger.411.d:0 "We've pushed the cowardly, back stabbing Italians past the Eternal City, Rome, and now they've finally surrendered to our great army.

ger.413.d:0 "Now that we've conquered Italy we have to decide what to do with the land. We can form a puppet Valkist government under cooperative Italian general, Rudolfo Graziani, cutting the cost of prolonged occupation.

ger.4211.d:0 "The fall of the British Isles has left the world in shock. The loss of the worlds largest empire leaves the fate of many nations in limbo.

ger.4213.d:0 "The British Isles have fallen into German hands. The fate of the Commonwealth is unknown and even the future of our nation is in jeopardy. It is clear to most that the British will not be able to protect the Pacific. We must take control of this disaster and bring the disparate British Colonies of the Pacific under Australian control.

Ever since the Spanish War of Succession the territory of Gibraltar. has been occupied by Britain, despite several attempts to reclaim it, but now the fall of the British Isles gives us the opportunity to settle this once and for all.

His controversial legacy has our government split on how to deal with him. Some Valkist ministers believe that being on good terms with the Kaiser will help bolster support from the more conservative elements of the German Reich but [GER.GetLeader] in a rage fulled rant stated 'That traitor left his people for dead when he abdicated!' and 'That man should pay for his crimes!'.

Germany promises to give us the territory if we join the their alliance, Stahlpakt, and assist them in dismantling the nation. An alliance with Germany could give us the leverage we need to reclaim the Greater Hungarian territories from Italy, Serbia and Transylvania but [GER.GetLeader] does not seem to be the most trustworthy person. Should we risk the safety of our nation, people and future just for the chance of Carpathian dominance?"
ger.10172.d:0 "Hungary followed through and joined our side in dealing with Bohemia. With their help we easily crushed the Slavic forces but now they demand control over Slovakia as part of our agreement. While it may have seemed like a good idea at the time many of our own generals believe that an alliance with the Hungarian state would be more of a burden than actually helpful.
