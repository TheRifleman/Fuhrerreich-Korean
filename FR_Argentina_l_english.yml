arg.1.t:0 "Argentina in 1936"
arg.1.d:0 "For decades, our nation has been ruled by the democratic dominance of the Unión Cívica Radical, or UCR, a social and liberal minded political party, whose dominance has caused great controversy in our society. It was to be expected groups with their own interests would use this political situation for their advantage.\n\nIn 1934, after the UCR's close victory against a coalition of opposition parties, Enrique Martínez assumed the charge of president. As Bolivia poised for victory in their conflict with Paraguay, Manuel Domecq, the war minister, and a prominent founding member of the nationalist group known as the Liga Patriótica Argentina, or LPA, used his influence in the recently elected president Martínez, who seeking further approval, declared war on Bolivia, on the charges of "maintaining order in the region". Domecq and the LPA sought to establish Argentinian hegemony in the region, while the UCR just wanted to increase their approval in a increasingly divided society. Nonetheless, the whole country united in support of the war effort.\n\nIt was a disaster, low in morale due to the poorly justified conflict, and just generally unprepared, the Argentinian military suffered elevated losses. While conscription allowed many of these to not alter the war effort, it altered our society. When Brazil saw the opportunity and demanded the war ended, and to return peace to the region, the government just accepted. Internally, the pressure of the anti-war collectivist and unionist movements was too strong, and threats of revolt remained in the government's mind.\nNow, the country is more divided politically than ever, as the memories of the war shape our politics and general discontent remains, almost nothing was won, yet we lost so much for it.\n\nAt least the economy's been doing good."
arg.1.a:0 "At least the economy's doing good."
arg.2.t:0 "London Market Crash arrives to Argentina"
arg.2.d:0 "As our nation seemed to steadily improving its internal situation, another they arrives, and with it great tragedy.\n\nThe London Stock Market Crash has arrived to Argentina, and with the british's great influence in our economy, our country awakens with chaos as sun rises and our economy falls, panic and upcoming chaos beginning to be felt by our population. A black sunrise for our nation."
arg.2.a:0 "Well, crap."
arg.3.t:0 "Major protests begin amidst crisis"
arg.3.d:0 "It seems the political tension has returned to Argentina, as the newly unemployed, the hungry and the angry take it to the streets in protest to our government.\n\nWhatever we do, we must remain calm, and act wisely, as to be able to return Argentina to its feet once again, without causing something we will regret, and, considering the recent surge of Collectivist activity and the return of the patriotic leagues, that may be hard."
arg.3.a:0 "We can try."
arg.4.t:0 "Ligas attack protesters"
arg.4.d:0 "As we have awaited for the popular discontent to decrease, and the situation to cool down, not everyone has been so patient. Members of the paramilitary patriotic leagues have taken it to themselves in dealing with the protesters, accusing them of being misled by marxist influence, and shooting out to the memories of the Patagonia Rebeled, and as such there have been cases of open aggresion against these protesters.\n\nWhile certainly a dissuasive force that is useful to a certain degree, can we really stand these groups attacking common people?"
arg.4.a:0 "We must stop the leagues."
arg.4.b:0 "They do what they feel is right."
arg.5.t:0 "Protester leaders want to negociate"
arg.5.d:0 "As the protests persist, we receive a glimmer of hope, as an official message from the leading protesters, the Collectivist leader Rodolfo Ghioldi, offering to negociate certain rights and a possible arrangemente. While we must be careful of who we are dealing with.\n\nOn the other hand, the LPA members in our government have repeatedly asked us to not accept any demands, as they believe negotiating with marxists may destroy our nation."

arg.5.b:0 "Any agreement that leads us to stability is good."
arg.6.t:0 "Protests intensify"
arg.6.d:0 "As we still try to deal with them, the protests intensify. Another mob of them has surrounded La Casa Rosada, and it seems they aren't any willing to leave.\n\nWhile we have done what we can to calm them down, it seems our government's survival is in danger, as glimmers of revolution appear in the protesters."

arg.40.b:0 "Any agreement that leads us to stability is good."
arg.50.t:0 "Government collapses to protests"
arg.50.d:0 "As the situation turned dire, violence increased, finally our government collapsed. The protesters turned revolutionaries, and overran La Casa Rosada. Buenos Aires turned red as the collectivists, as well as other revolutionary socialists, take over, and the republic of old is gone.\n\nA new Argentina has risen from its ashes, one made for and by the workers! The revolutionaries cheer as the new chairman Ghioldi announces the founding of the Collective of Argentina, the new workers' state that will bring socialist prosperity and brings us out of the crisis!"
arg.50.a:0 "La revolución recién comienza."
arg.51.t:0 "Our republic in crisis"
arg.51.d:0 "As the situation escalates and all seems dire, the government is about to collapse. We have, however, tried all we can to turn things right, and after today the fate of Argentina is decided.\n\nWill our government persist and survive, or will the protest turn into a revolution?"
arg.51.a:0 "The revolution arrives in Argentina."
arg.51.b:0 "The government struggles but the republic survives."
arg.52.d:0 "As we have handled the protests, the tension is still too much. People are unhappy and our government can't survive as it is. However, a chance has arrived.\n\nThe LPA, leading the fight against the protests, has helped us so far. While widely considered too extreme to lead a government, Admiral Domecq has offered us a pact. The LPA will gain greater influence in the government, but it seems only this way will the republic survive. Together, we are strong, and we will come out of this."
arg.52.t:0 "Survival at a price"
arg.52.a:0 "Finally, a patriotic government to lead us."
arg.53.t:0 "Violence increases as crisis escalates"
arg.53.d:0 "As the protesters turn into revolutionaries, and the violence increase, the patriotic leagues begin fighting off the revolutionaries. While they might not be able to hold them off for long, if we as government decide to give the LPA our support, combined we might we able to turn the tide and save the republic. Otherwise, the streets of Buenos Aires will turn red with the revolutionary tide."
arg.53.a:0 "Together, the LPA-UCR pact will save the republic."
arg.53.b:0 "The revolution succeeds as the old government collapses."
arg.10.t:0 "Government deals with the Labourers"
arg.10.d:0 "The weeks of labourers protesting over additional rights have come to an end, as our government officially announces the negotiations have finished and the workers go back to their regular work.\n\nWhile issues like this are to be expected, right-wing affiliated government officers have expressed their discontent in the goverment bending to the protesters' demands, while the government is clear it means to do whatever is necessary to solve any issues in a peaceful way."
arg.10.a:0 "It's nice for the workers to demand and get their needs."
arg.10.b:0 "Those who oppose order should be dispatched with force."
arg.11.t:0 "LPA factionalism as plurality is called for."
arg.11.d:0 "As the government called for plurality in reaction to the current climate critizising their democratic dominion of the electoral system, certain politicians affiliated to the LPA have tried to form a faction in our legislation, although the movement is not an official political party.\n\nThey argue it is in their free right, as well as several prominent LPA members of the government have declared their support in doing so, however, others have shown great discontent in this and it would surely enrage the chamber if we allowed this."
arg.11.a:0 "They are in their right to freely associate."
arg.11.b:0 "The LPA is not an official political party."
arg.12.t:0 "Collectivists politicize memorial"
arg.12.d:0 "As a memorial to those lost in the last war is unveiled by the government, Collectivist groups have taken it to demonstrate nearby, blaming the government for the mistakes of the war and pushing their own platform\n\n While most consider this display distasteful, it is hard to argue that the intervention in the war came out of the blue for most, and maybe a different government would have meant avoiding such losses."
arg.12.a:0 "We won't tolerate those disrespecting as we honour our fallen."
arg.12.b:0 "The radicals are blind to the blood on their hands."
arg.13.t:0 "Dialogue between government and opposition"
arg.13.d:0 "As the situation of our country has been carefully handled, today the government established friendly dialogue with the opposition, and seems to be at peace with dissidents in their won party, as well as with groups of differing ideology, wishing the best for Argentina bringing them all together."
arg.13.a:0 "It seems things are going our way."
arg.14.t:0 "The Revolution Arrives to Argentina"
arg.14.d:0 "As the workers' protests increased and social agitation grew, it reached the point where the government couldn't do anything, as it was in disarray.\n\nIt was from this chaos that the revolutionary workers mobilized and toppled the government, as the streets of cities all over Argentina turned red under the socialist flag. Now the old regime is gone, and the revolution rules Argentina. The ideologues of the Collectivist party, lead by Rodolfo Ghioldi, taking the lead in the insurrection and in this new revolutionary order."
arg.14.a:0 "The proletariat will be victorious."
arg.15.t:0 "Agitation as state nationalizes Industry"
arg.15.d:0 "As part of the wide reforms imposed by our socialist government, the nationalization of industry under the workers' control has been essential. This maneuver, however, has proved unpopular with many small and medium sized enterprises, who are agitating and producing chaos in our society. Reactionaries truly are found deep in our society."
arg.15.a:0 "We don't have time for this."
arg.16.t:0 "Reactionaries flee as government centralizes"
arg.16.d:0 "As our revolutionary government has began further centralizing its control over society, the reactionaries that still hold dear to their "democratic" traditions have decided to cross the border into neighbours countries where they can escape the revolution.\n\n It may be a good idea to limit this population flow, and do as we can to strengthen argentinian society, even if it would ease the tensions of our society to let them go."
arg.16.a:0 "Let them go."
arg.16.b:0 "Stop them."
arg.17.t:0 "The Red Sunrise"
arg.17.d:0 "On this day, we are commemorating all what we have gone through since the revolution began, as the new system is firmly settled, and the issues of the past are left behind, we can now look in pride as Argentina stands as a bastion for the workers, of revolution, in South America."
arg.17.a:0 "The Sun has risen for the workers."


arg.20.t:0 "The Confederation stands together"
arg.20.d:0 "As massive revolts wrapped our country, and the political crisis struck after the economic one arrived, the loyalists to the republic, no matter their ideology, stuck together and kept the government amidst the chaos.\n\n However, our government is currently extremely weakened in power and support by these events, and revolutionaries as well as other dissidents are strong in here. While we can try to carefully work through these issues alone, an offer has come to our attention, Admiral Domecq García, our war minister and elevated member of the LPA, says if we agree to give the LPA a greater influence in the government and legislation, they will give our government their backing and will make sure our regime is stable enough to advance through the chaos. We have to be wary, though."
arg.20.a:0 "The UCR will stand alone fixing our issues."
arg.20.b:0 "A pact with the LPA is necessary."
arg.21.t:0 "Opposition dissents to subsidization measures"
arg.21.d:0 "While our government has found most appropiate to fund the ailing enterprises to sustain the economy, this kind of intervention has not been approved by the more conservative parts of our society, and the opposition has been fast at telling us so."
arg.21.a:0 "We do what we must for Argentina."
arg.21.b:0 "Maybe we are going too far."


arg.22.t:0 "Socialist protests the educative reform"
arg.22.d:0 "As a government we have always cared for the Argentinian youth to get the best education it can, but not everyone agrees with our means. Recently, after the plans for the announced reforms were published, socialists have taken to protest at these reforms, stating that the new plans are biased and non-neutral politically. While we value their opinions, that's strictly wrong and we can't tolerate such demonstrations."
arg.22.a:0 "We don't need revolutionaries."
arg.23.t:0 "The Sun Rises Again"
arg.23.d:0 "We have gone through a lot. War, loss, healing, wounds, crashes, chaos, disarray, and unity. We have come together and risen forward as an united nation. As democracy in Argentina prevails under the banner of radicalism, a new sunrise arrives in our great nation."
arg.23.a:0 "We are awesome."

arg.24.t:0 "Restrictions on Labour Imposed"
arg.24.d:0 "As the government has found prudent to reduce the freedoms of the workers' unions, as part of our policies to improve Argentina's condition, we have found great amount of protesters against this measure, as expected. While these traitors to the fatherland have no issue protesting as they please even if it is not allowed, it may be a good idea to give them a few more issues to deal with."
arg.24.a:0 "Just a few."
arg.25.t:0 "The New Argentina"
arg.25.d:0 "Argentina lived under the foreign yoke for too long. That is the case no more, as people wake in pride of their nation, whether sunny or through a storm, whatever weather, cold or warm, our national pride will guide us, as we know the Argentinian nation is fated for great things, and we will do our best for it."
arg.25.a:0 "God Save the Fatherland."
arg.26.t:0 "Patriotic Squads harass workers"
arg.26.d:0 "As the new reborn ligas are assembled, reports are coming of some of them approaching industrial areas to harass workers in zones with unionist antecedents. While we understand their reasoning, many consider this move uncalled for."
arg.26.a:0 "Proceed, please."
arg.26.b:0 "Punish those units."
arg.27.t:0 "Who should be import from?"
arg.27.d:0 "As the plan to update our current stockpile of equipment, making sure our armed forces are in proper form, we have yet to decise who should be import these weapons from. This decision, more than economical, will strengthen diplomatic ties between our countries.\nA popular yet controversial option is Germany. Their aggressive government makes good weapons, and their self sustaining economical model is of good example to us.\nAn interesting alternative, the French and our people hold no grudges, and may be a conservative pick.\nWhile trading with the US seems like a risky business but may lead to good things. "
arg.27.a:0 "German weapons is what we need."
arg.27.b:0 "Let's not forget what success british trade brought us."
arg.27.c:0 "Perhaps the French will provide as we need."
arg.27.e:0 "Weapons made in the new world is better."

On the other hand, just giving them up may be a bad idea for its effects on our morale and the the empire's status and prestige."

However, a token of peace, say, the northern province of Tarija, which used to belong to Bolivia, and is still a zone of tension, may be the key to friendly relationships.

And they have decided to implement an open internationalist policy of friendship and collaboration between socialist countries.\n\nThus, we have been invited to join Argentina's alliance, providing stronger bonds not only symbolically, but also when it comes to the defense of the revolution from reactionaries. Should we accept?"
arg.111.a:0 "Join Argentina's Faction."
arg.111.b:0 "We'd rather work alone for now."
arg.112.t:0 "Peru joins our alliance"
arg.112.d:0 "In the name of international cooperation and friendship, as well as revolution, Peru has found itself joining our international socialist alliance, providing a strong partner for ventures in South America."
arg.112.a:0 "Excellent News!"
arg.113.t:0 "Peru rejects our offer"
arg.113.d:0 "It seems that Peru's leadership has had its mind on concerns beyond the defense of south american socialism, as it has rejected our offer."
arg.113.a:0 "Sad!"

arg.200.t:0 "Argentina Invites us to Research Pact"
arg.200.d:0 "As a fellow socialist country, Argentina has established a pact in which technological developments can be shared between south american revolutionary countries. Should we join?"
arg.200.a:0 "It may be a good idea."
arg.200.b:0 "I'd rather not."


arg.250.t:0 "Split in the Collectivist Party"
arg.250.d:0 "A recent political division has occured. The members of the Collectivist Party of Argentina known as the vanguardist faction have split and formed their own party, the Vanguard Federal People's Party, based on the ideology of Vanguard Socialism.\n\nThis ideological divide is based on the extreme ideas that their ideology proposes, several of which are considered revisionist by orthodox groups, like the establishment of a centralized, highly authoritarian and controlling socialist state led by the vanguard party as the end goal for their brand of socialism. While the Collectivists lament this division, the Anarchists in the Collective have shown optimism at this new development, a divided collectivist party allowing them a better chance at representation of their own ideas in the upcoming Congress next year."
arg.250.a:0 "We didn't like those guys anyways."
arg.251.t:0 "UCR reunites"
arg.251.d:0 "After around 15 years separated, the Unión Cívica Radical Antipersonalista has announced together with the original UCR, they will reunify, and as such, bring a stronger, less factionalist radicalism to Argentina.\n\nWidely considered a political move based on the recent growth of non-radicalist groups in our political environment, many feel this may bring the change to the party it needs to properly compete in the next elections we face."
arg.251.a:0 "United we stand strong."
arg.252.t:0 "Elections of 1940"
arg.252.d:0 "Time has come for our democratic tradition to continue, and elect the republic's next president.\n\n This election, the man in the spotlight is Carlos Saavedra Lamas. A prominent diplomat, he stands for Partido Demócrata Nacional, and, is widely considered one of the leading men in bringing fresh air to Argentinian politics, although many consider he won't be that different from our previous governments.\n\nThe UCR's candidate, Vicente Gallo, has been a stauch defender of antipersonalist, and seeks to rather than get the UCR out of power, bring change to it internally, leading as a member of a different branch of the UCR we are accustomed to seeing.\n\nFinally, the most different candidate perhaps, is Alfredo Palacios. Popular with unionists and the lower classes, and leader of the Socialist Party, he wants to bring his socialists ideas to Argentina, not through revolution, but through democratic means."
arg.252.a:0 "Saavedra is elected (Social Conservative)."
arg.252.b:0 "Gallo is elected (Market Liberal)."
arg.252.c:0 "Palacios is elected (Social Democrat)."
arg.253.t:0 "The Infamous Day"
arg.253.d:0 "Not many expected it, yet it somehow felt like the obvious conclusion. The steadily on the rise LPA saw the chance and prepared to seize it. As leading LPA members followed by militant groups marched through Buenos Aires to seize total and direct control of the government, chaos surged."
arg.253.a:0 "The LPA coup succeeds, the nationalists take over."
arg.253.b:0 "Conservative military officers counter-coup to safeguard the republic."
arg.254.t:0 "The Workers' Congress of 41'"
arg.254.d:0 "As the revolution settles in, and the ideologies of our society diverge, it is time for a Congress where the workers of Argentina will decide their leadership.\n\nWith the years the political landscape of our country has changed. Nonetheless the main factions that have formed are clear.\n\nThe Orthodox Collectivists, directly representing the government that took control during the Revolution and lead us to break our chains, they are lead by current chairman Rodolfo Ghioldi, and want to maintain the current direction our socialist society is developing in.\n\nA extreme faction that split off not long ago, characterized by their revisionist, unorthodox ideas, are the Vanguard Federal People's Party, lead by vanguardist Fanny Jacobsky, proposing a state-centric, rather authoritarian, and diplomatically expansionist doctrine. Many consider them to be a dangerous faction, for either us or our enemies.\n\nFinally, the unionists and anarchists have formed a rather large faction under the FACA, titularly lead by José Grunfeld, representing the interests of those that want a more local minded and autonomous, libertarian kind of socialism."
arg.254.a:0 "The Orthodox Collectivists prevail."
arg.254.b:0 "The Anarchists gain majority support."
arg.254.c:0 "The Vanguardists succeed."
arg.300.d:0 "As we transition into an anarchist and syndicalist society, hidden reactionary groups that have been hiding underground have been rising and disturbing the worker councils in different provinces.\n\nUse of violence is not the best option, but doing nothing may upset more than a few people, we have to decide how to act."
arg.300.t:0 "Reactionaries causing disturbance"
arg.300.a:0 "There is nothing we can do."
arg.300.b:0 "Use force to get rid of them."
arg.301.t:0 "Workers prosper in the Commune"
arg.301.d:0 "After implementing several measures to guide our country, the argentinian proletariat finally has reached prosperity, and we can look hopefully towards the future.\n\nThe people united will always win in the end, as we have learned our lessons and implemented socialism in the best way for the unions and the workers."
arg.301.a:0 "Viva el trabajador!"
arg.302.t:0 "Collectivist dominance critisized"
arg.302.d:0 "Leading the revolution, the collecivists gained great influence in our society in every aspect. As such, it came as no surprise when they dominated in the congress of 41'.\n\nNow, however, certain political groups, mainly anarchist, have critizised our dominion as "anti-democratic" and rather authoritarian or oligargic. We have failed to reply to these claims."
arg.302.a:0 "This is ridiculous."
arg.303.t:0 "Prominent Collectivist Minister murdered"
arg.303.d:0 "Earlier this morning, after a meeting in the Revolutionary Congress in Buenos Aires, one of the most prominent ministers of the government, Jose Fernando Penelón, was murdered when walking home. This act of violence, and hatred has put the country in shock, as a proper investigation has began, and not only reactionaries are in question, but also socialists in opposition to the government."
arg.303.a:0 "We will find the criminal and deliver justice."
arg.304.d:0 "A potential lead in the investigation of the crime has pointed towards anarchist methods in the murder, and tension has grown between us and their faction.\n\nWhile the anarchists have been very supportive of the government and lament the crime, they are a suspect so far in the investigation."
arg.304.t:0 "Evidence suggests anarchist involvement"
arg.304.a:0 "Further investigate anarchists."
arg.304.b:0 "Look for further clues."
arg.305.t:0 "Evidence comes up short"
arg.305.d:0 "While looking for further evidence of anarchist involvement in the murder, we have found ourselves with no more clues or hints of their involvement.\n\nWe have, however, found the anger of their faction, and caused a general feel the government is overstepping its boundaries."
arg.305.a:0 "Damn it!"
arg.306.t:0 "Evidence of Vanguardist involvement"
arg.306.d:0 "A vocal opponent of the vanguardists, it comes to no surprise as we have found evidence of vanguardist involvement in the murder of Penelón. It seems the faction has tried to subvert our order and increase their influence in the congress, eliminating their rivals. While dangerous, a potential action to arrest the conspirators may damage the Vanguardists and bring further order to us, but is dangerous and costly."
arg.306.a:0 "Bring Justice."
arg.306.b:0 "Keep the knowledge to ourselves."
arg.307.t:0 "Vanguardist conspirators arrested"
arg.307.d:0 "As we moved in, we succesfully arrested the conspirators responsible for the murder. While many of the higher members of the party have clean names so far, their popularity has diminished and we will keep vigilant for anything shady going on."
arg.307.a:0 "I love the smell of justice in the morning."
arg.308.t:0 "Collectivists and Anarchist form front"
arg.308.d:0 "Dubbing our reforms as totalitarian and personalist, ridiculously, the Orthodox Collectivists and the Anarchists have formed a coalition in attempt to oppose our democratically elected regime.\n\nIt seems they don't care for what people want. We will have to deal with them carefully. And with force."
arg.308.a:0 "With much force."
arg.309.t:0 "The Great Step"
arg.309.d:0 "As we have had to deal with enemies all around us, both reactionaries and those that believe they deserve to call themselves "socialists", we have come to realize that this won't do if we want to lead this nation to greatness with socialist ideals.\n\nIt is time to implement the next step in our plan."
arg.309.a:0 "Wait no more."
arg.310.d:0 "The streets of Buenos Aires were empty, it was the early hours of the morning. Suddenly, the announcement came. No one is allowed to go out to the streets today.\n\nThe loyal citizens respected our order. Those who didn't were disposed of quickly. Our forces stormed the headquarters of the Collectivist-Anarchist coalition, and captured their leadership. Officially, now all political parties except the Vanguard Federal People's Party are banned. Those who dissent are criminals. Our rule will be respected, and only this way the proletariat will achieve socialism uninterrupted."
arg.310.t:0 "Taking Over"
arg.310.a:0 "No room for opposition here."
arg.311.t:0 "Traitors desert the army."
arg.311.d:0 "As part of our policy of rooting out traitors to our nation, several prominent army groups have expressed discontent in our investigation, and have chosen to desert, leaving our army like the traitors they are.\n\nThis includes our generals, and prominent officer Agustin P. Justo has also left in this incident."
arg.311.a:0 "We don't need them!"
arg.312.t:0 "Constitution and Democracy Abolished"
arg.312.d:0 "As part of the political policies of the regime, it was clear that the coup wasn't intended to be a temporary takeover, and as our glorious leader Domecq leads our forces and our men into making Argentina great, he doesn't rule as our president.\n\nToday, it was made official, the democratic structure, the president, and the senate, have all been abolished, only true patriots can rule Argentina, not oligarchs disguising under democracy."
arg.312.a:0 "Viva Argentina!"
arg.313.t:0 "Ligas sympathizers arrested"
arg.313.d:0 "As we move towards eliminating traces left by the paramilitary structure of the patriotic leagues, we find great number of our men have sympathies to the LPA cause, and as such are a threat to our national stability.\n\nWe will miss the soldiers, but this is the price of freedom."
arg.313.a:0 "We did what we had to."
arg.314.t:0 "Military March in honor to the regime"
arg.314.d:0 "Crowds reunite in Buenos Aires as the military marches, honouring the brave junta that has saved our nation.\n\nSeeing the people reunited in this occassion reminds us of how everything will be okay, under the current regime."
arg.314.a:0 "Everything will be ok."
arg.315.t:0 "Minor demonstrations against radicalist dominance"
arg.315.d:0 "As the new government setles it, the fact that through all that has happened the UCR has mantained its dominance in our politics has not boded well with everyone.\n\nSeveral small demonstrations through our country have happened, and while they have been peaceful and not radical, no pun intended, it seems clear the people doesn't want this dominance to continue."
arg.315.a:0 "But it won't end today."
arg.316.t:0 "Widely acclaimed presidential speech"
arg.316.d:0 ""Today we are reunited, because we all share something in common. We have been all through highs and lows, some, more lows than others. Nonetheless, we have kept on fighting on and are still here today, and we share so much in common. We all belong to this proud nation, to Argentina. And when extremists planned to bring us down we did not give up!\n\nAnd we you didn't know what to believe in, you still gave us the benefit of the doubt, and together, we pulled through. This isn't about me or you or anyone else. It is about us. United, this country will survive through anything, and I hope you are willing to help us, to be part of this."\n\nThe crowds cheered as president Gallo finished his speech. Not that much people attended, but those who did were happy to have come."
arg.316.a:0 "We will do great things."
arg.317.t:0 "People celebrate at government change"
arg.317.d:0 "As the Radicalist government ends, and a new political direction takes hold of Argentina, people all around cheer, as change has finally come to our nation, and by peaceful, democratic means too.\n\nAll of our efforts lead to what we wanted, and now we have to hope for the best."
arg.317.a:0 "We did it."
arg.318.t:0 "Economic boom as the new economic policies settle"
arg.318.d:0 "It seems the management that the PDN has brought us has been the right kind, cause we are experiencing a new economic boom out of its policies. While we don't expect it to last long, this is the kind of good things we have missed."
arg.318.a:0 "We chose wisely."
arg.319.t:0 "A president for the people"
arg.319.d:0 "In an unexpected result, the socialist politician, and now president, Alfredo Palacios, has won the election. Reactions are mixed, while some of the more militant elements of our society seem to doubt this pick, the lower classes seem to be happy and hopeful, specially the unions."
arg.319.a:0 "Gotta hope."
arg.320.t:0 "Peace in our society"
arg.320.d:0 "As the social questions are answered, it seems the chaos that affected our country has stopped haunting us, and those are distant memories.\n\nUnited, we hope for a better future for every argentinian, and now we will work to make it happen."
arg.320.a:0 "En Unión y Libertad."

arg.347.t:0 "Support from the Argentinians"
arg.347.d:0 "As our bloody war against the traitors that have sought to brought this nation down continues, we receive some supplies to help our fight from the Argentinians. It seems they too, are interested in our conflict. While we can't trust them, it is understandable and we will make good use of the supplies."
arg.347.a:0 "Just what we needed!"
arg.348.t:0 "Aid from the Argentine Republic"
arg.348.d:0 "As our forces and supplies are stretched, a glimmer of hope remains, and it seems other have faith in us, too. The Argentinians have decided to send us weapons to help in our fight. While this kind of help isn't expected of them more than for their own benefit, we can't help but be grateful at this."
arg.348.a:0 "Just what we needed."
arg.349.t:0 "Aid from the southern collectivists"
arg.349.d:0 "A glimmer of help, and unity between the workers has arrived, as the Argentinian proletariat, after their succesful revolution, have decided to help our cause, and have brought us supplies to help us in our fight. Comradeship truly goes far."
arg.349.a:0 "Just what we needed!"
arg.350.t:0 "The Brazilian Intervention"
arg.350.d:0 "Chaos has strived in the region for too long. And now, it seems like dangerous factions are close to reaching domination of Brazil, and we simply can't allow that to happen. The time to intervene has come, and we will strike down the populist State, that has threatened and hurt the interests of the workers of not only Brazil, but so too the world."
arg.350.a:0 "Make them taste the pain!"
arg.351.t:0 "The Argentinian Aggressors"
arg.351.d:0 "It seems in an act of cowardry, the collies in their Union have realized they can't deal with this alone, and called forth their international friends, and our national enemies, the Argentinians. Not only betraying the Brazilian people, and their homeland, but also shocking everyone.\n\n A glimmer of hope remains though, as many brave men that were yet undecided of how to fight for have risen to help Brazil against this invasion by foreign enemies!."
arg.351.a:0 "For Brazil!"
arg.352.t:0 "A Succesful Intervention"
arg.352.d:0 "As our men have pushed deep into their homeland, it seems the right-wing militants of the People's State can hold on no more, as our forces overrun them. Simply put, our intervention has been succesful. Now, it's time to liberate these provinces and grant them to our friend, the Union.\n\nAn interesting thought has been proposed though. What if we were to... occupy a few of these, temporarily. Purely as a way of ensuring their safety as the Union has its own matters to attend to. This may enrage more than a few brazilians however, including our comrades."
arg.352.a:0 "Let's liberate them to the Union, in good faith."
arg.352.b:0 "Liberate some, occupy some."
arg.353.t:0 "Argentinian Comrades liberate State territories."
arg.353.d:0 "As a show of comradeship and socialist internationalism, the socialists in Argentina have in their intervention decided to liberate the southern lands occupied by the People's State, as a way of helping us.\n\nIt seems with socialism any former nationalist rivalries can be left in the past."
arg.353.a:0 "Viva O Proletariado!"
arg.354.t:0 "Argentinian Collectivists occupy southern land."
arg.354.d:0 "While their intervention was clearly intended on helping us, and they did liberate some of our territories, the Argentinians have decided to occupy some of southern Brazil. While claming this is only to contain the right-wing instability in the area, helping us, it is yet to be seen if those are their only motives."
arg.355.t:0 "The Intervention Fails"
arg.355.d:0 "As our men have tried to advance for months, it seems like the State just won't give up any inch. Now the intervention has been deemed a failure internally, and has hurt our government. Thus, it may be for the best if we just recall the whole operation."
arg.355.a:0 "It was a mistake."
arg.355.b:0 "No, the revolution won't stop here."
arg.356.t:0 "The Fate of Brazil"
arg.356.d:0 "After the long and bloody war, our enemy finally has fallen. With it, a new age comes for South America, an age where the might of Argentina will be respected. However, we have found ourselves with quite an issue. The occupied brazilian territories are just too large and populous to directly hold. Thus, it seems that we might need to establish a friendly government in the zone, showing the Brazilians how kindly we liberated them from the curse of Collectivism. However, our own ambitions may have to be considerated, too!"
arg.356.a:0 "Liberate Brazil and occupy the Sul."
arg.356.b:0 "Liberate all of Brazil."
arg.356.c:0 "Occupation is preferable."
arg.357.t:0 "The Invasion of Brazil"
arg.357.d:0 "Now that Brazil is divided, it is finally time to strike and extend our control over this continent. The natural choice has been to invade the populists in the South, who, while clearly more sensical than the marxists, are in prime position for us to conquer. Thus we can't wait no more. It's time to Invade!"
arg.357.a:0 "We'll be great."
arg.358.t:0 "The opportunist Argentinians"
arg.358.d:0 "Treacherous and opportunistic, the Argentinian are a failed people with delusions of Grandeur, and traditions of unequal warfare, and desire to be more than what they are or deserve to be.\n\nIt wasn't surprising at all that they would decide to use the precarious position of our nation at the hands of traitors and oligarchs to exploit us and invade us. But we falter not! As the Brazilian nation is valiant and relentless, many brave men who didn't want to fight at the thought of hurting their compatriots have risen up and joined us in the defense of Brazil from these venomous invaders."
arg.358.a:0 "They won't bring us down.
arg.359.t:0 "Victory in the Brazilian Front?"
arg.359.d:0 "As our troops clashed and the front moved, it seems we have the People's State cornered. Thus, we can send a peace offer, taking their southern provinces and extending our regional control, weakening Brazil overall. Another alternative could be to keep up in the war, but this may be costly and unpopular with our people, that have longed for a victory like this one."
arg.359.a:0 "Send a peace offer."
arg.359.b:0 "This is total war."
arg.360.t:0 "A peace offer?"
arg.360.d:0 "As the treacherous Argentinians exploited our weakness and made the front collapse upon us, it seems we have no choice but to cede them our southern lands, weakening us. While this is not the option we want, continuing on this war will seal our fate in the civil war, and if we let them go now, we may be able to reclaim our lands later."
arg.360.a:0 "Accept the offer."
arg.360.b:0 "Reject it."
arg.361.t:0 "Brazilians reject our offer."
arg.361.d:0 "In a surprising move, the People's State has not accepted our generous offer. It seems their fate is sealed them, as we will conquer them."

arg.362.d:0 "After the long and bloody war, our enemy finally has fallen. With it, a new age comes for South America, an age where the might of Argentina will be respected. However, we have found ourselves with quite an issue. The occupied brazilian territories are just too large and populous to directly hold.

arg.362.b:0 "Liberate all of Brazil."
arg.362.c:0 "Occupation is preferable."
arg.363.t:0 "The Invasion Fails"
arg.363.d:0 "As the months go by, the Brazilians tenaciously hold on. The war effort has only resulted in losses, and the memories of the past failures are invading our people once again. It seems we may be forced to call off this invasion, lest the people decide to call us off."
