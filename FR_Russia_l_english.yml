#### events ####
rus.0.d:0 "The land of the Russians was at one point the world’s third largest empire, spanning three continents. Although a military powerhouse, the largely rural and non-industrialized Russian Empire lagged heavily behind its European neighbors. In 1914, after the Archduke of Austria was shot by a Serbian in Sarajevo, Russia mobilized to defend its Serbian ally against the invading Austrian army. Thus began the Great War between the Russians, the British, and the French against the Germans, the Austrians, and the Ottomans.\n\nThe Great War was a war unlike any other. As the Central Powers pushed east, morale lowered and unrest grew until the melting point where most of Russia was in arms against the monarchy in 1917, beginning the February Revolution. The Tsar eventually abdicated his power to the revolutionaries, who were an unstable pact between the Petrograd Soviet lead by the collectivist Bolsheviks and the Provisional Government led by republicans. Street fighting and an advancing German Army led to the pact being broken and Civil War declared to decide the fate of Russia– the socialist Bolsheviks, led by revolutionary Vladimir Lenin, or the big tent anti-Bolshevik White Movement.\n\nBy 1920, White-controlled territory in Russia had been limited to pockets and exclaves around Siberia and Central Asia. Kolchak, Supreme Leader of the White Force had been captured and handed over to the Bolsheviks. He officially resigned and handed all control over White civil and military power in Siberia to his last general in the region– Ataman Semyonov. By February, the Ataman and his Cossack army were completely surrounded in Transbaikal, connected to Allied and Czechoslovak controlled Primorsky through Japanese controlled railways. The Siberian Intervention was the main factor for the continued survival of the White Army. The Intervention included the Japanese, the Czechoslovak Legions, the United States, Italy, the United Kingdom, and France as well as thousands of Poles and Canadians. All sides of the intervention had similar yet different goals and took very active roles in the intervention. The United States, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom had the goals of preventing war material from falling into Bolshevik hands, rescuing the Czechoslovak Legions, and resurrecting the Eastern Front. Meanwhile, the Japanese had a more imperialist intent, seeking to either expand their sphere of influence or simply gain a buffer state. Their man was Semyonov in Chita. Japan notably sent 70,000 troops to fight in Siberia, while President Theodore Roosevelt sent 30,000."
rus.1.d:0 "After Kolchak was captured and resigned, he was subsequently executed. After losing their biggest ally, the French and British soon evacuated from Siberia entirely but Japanese support continued as Semyonov was able to negotiate with a reluctant United States for continued support. On April 6th, 1920, a non-White Far Eastern Republic was declared in Chita. The United States and Japan quickly opened dialogue with this Far Eastern Republic. Japan and the United States both insisted that Semyonov’s Transbaikal government to be included in the negotiations, but the Far Eastern Republic declined and the United States and Japan quickly closed dialogue and returned to supporting Semyonov’s Transbaikal government. Eventually, the Far Eastern Republic government was expelled from Transbaikal altogether. By 1922, the American-Japanese forces as well as the White forces would successfully control large sections of Amur, Transbaikal, Primorsky, and Primorye as the civil war grinded into a halt with extremely limited engagements on either side. Bolsheviks began returning home. On October 25th, 1922, a major communist uprising was put down by White armies and their Japanese and American allies, marking the last conflict in the civil war, as it effectively reached an end.\n\nWith this effective end of the civil war, internally the White Government called themselves the All-Russian White Government in the Eastern Outskirts of Trans-Baikal, Amur, and Primorye. However, most countries call it the Russian White Government or simply the White Government. While most countries still do not recognize the Soviet Union and instead recognize the White Government as the legitimate Russian adnministration, it does not have much military strength to back up these claims. As part of an effort to further consolidate authority and legitimacy in this new governance, Japan and the United States together with Italy, the United Kingdom, and France would establish the “Allied Eastern Russian Commission”guarantee to oversee the White Government’s independence and, despite Grigory Semyonov taking the title of Supreme Leader, create the semblance of a democracy in the region by establishing a legislative Duma with an electoral process. However, these elections are to this day consistently rigged and the Duma remains extremely weak, filled mostly with supporters of the white movement and similar allied conservative movements. As of today, most of the power is still held by Semyonov and White generals and all other governmental bodies have merely rubber-stamping duties."
rus.2.d:0 "An anonymous general has testified before the Allied Eastern Russian Commission that Grigory Semyonov has embezzled funds. Should this information become public, the government would be greatly damaged and the already fragile image of the White government would deteriorate even further."
rus.3.d:0 "Despite government efforts, information regarding Semyonov's embezzling has been leaked to the public! While investigation into the sources of the leaks has begun in an attempt to subvert their spread, rumours indicate that democratic sympathizing bureaucrats working for the Allied Eastern Russian Commission had a hand in this affair. If this is proven true and the Commission had any play in this leaks, their autonomous and all-powerful condition means that our hands are tied in preventing the spread of news. God save us!"
rus.4.d:0 "In response to the weakness of the current administration, democratic and populist parties have started to negotiate the formation of possible United Front to run in the elections. While we could always rig our democratic institutions and threaten their members not to participate, the presence of Western observers and the current unpopularity of our government brought about by the embezzling issue have tied our hands in doing anything, lest we make ourselves even more unpopular."
rus.5.d:0 "After successful negotiations, democratic forces have finally formed a coalition to beat the current status quo. Calling themselves the National Union of Salvation, there goal is to depose the regime and create a democratic state. While in the past these attempts at democracy would have been repressed, defections amongst the military to their bloc and government fragility hamper these efforts."
rus.6.d:0 "Protests have broken out in Vladivostock in support of the National Union of Salvation and against Semyonov. To make matters worse, local garrison have refused to supress the rebellious and many have joined their ranks calling for democracy!"
rus.7.d:0 "Attempts at supressing the protest in Vladivostock has only tossed even more fuel into the wildfire, and anti-governmental revolts are spreading across all of Primorsky. Hundreds have taken to the streets in both violent and peaceful marches, protests and revolts, with police forces and garrisons quickly being overwhelmed or outright defecting to the other side! The government has only choice at this point if it plans to stay alive."
rus.8.d:0 "The government has officially lost control over even its military divisions, which have refused to fight the protesters. Led by a group of pro-democratic officials, the defection of these troops not only has swelled the forces of the anti-governmental actors, but it has also led to the breakdown of our military organization and cohesion."
rus.9.d:0 "Protests have coalesced into outright rebellion and Primorsky has been completely taken by forces opposing the Amur-Transbaikal administration. There, the National Union of Salvation has formed a temporary rival administration with its seat in Vladivostock and prepares to conduct major governmental reforms and assure the construction of a new democratic paradigm. Seeking to crush these revolters would likely mean the end for us, as rumours spread and indicate that even the Allied Eastern Russian Commission has begun talks with the Vladivostock administration and is planning on supporting their more stable and democratic regime over the Amur-Transbaikal government."
rus.10.d:0 "The Allied Eastern Commission has officially recognized the traitors in Vladivostock as the rightful White Russian government. This is gonna be a great hit to the Transbaikal loyalists and quickly it appears that their administration is not expected to last."
rus.11.d:0 "All sources indicate that the Vladivostock temporary government is preparing an attack on the last provinces that remain loyal to the Transbaikal administration. While they have a big army, surely they won't be able to beat them."
rus.12.d:0 "The traitors have started their  push onto the last loyal provinces in the west of the nation. While government victory isn't certain, there still is a chance they can push them back and execute them for their crimes."
rus.13.d:0 "The rebels have crossed the Amur River and are on there way to depose the old guard. The small amount of people who still are supporting the old guard are getting nervous and there is the threat of another wave of defection."
rus.14.d:0 "As a new day begins, White Russian generals grow wary and alarmed at the anti-governmental wave that has swept across the regions of Amur and now approach Chita."
rus.15.d:0 "A day in and out of fighting the rebels and the White Russian military governance has decided to solemnly step down and allow the occupation and takeover of Chita from their hands. The Vladivostock administration commemorates, and leading Union of Salvation members have proclaimed their commitment in creating a Russia where the common man is represented, free from socialism."
rus.16.d:0 "Today was a long day for the new White Russian administration as massive administrative reforms have begun in order to arrange that democracy can be properly constructed in this country, together with the arrest and trial of Semyonov for corruption and anti-state activities, and the reorganization of the military. But all of these efforts are worth it, the NUP argues, as it becomes clear that a new age has arrived in White Russia."
rus.17.d:0 "A political deadlock has been formed in the Provisional Government regarding posturing towards the Soviet sympathizers. While all can agree that the USSR should be eradicated and Russia restored, the Oktoberists and the core figures of the Union of Salvation propose banning organizations who advocate pacifism or some sort of compromise with socialism or the USSR in White Russia. However, such a stance isn't accepted by the other parties, who advocate for free democracy without authoritarianism. While either sides could see a successful victory in the debate, it would split the current administration, bringing in political instability. Thus, a compromise supported by a referendum has arisen as a valid option."
rus.18.d:0 "The compromise of using a referendum, despite being a compromise, has not been supported at all by the core faction of the Union of Salvation or the Oktoberists. Thus, the political gridlock has intensified in the temporary government."
rus.19.d:0 "The political chaos and instability brought by this gridlock in the temporary government has brought about great insatisfaction from the people, most of which were not that interested in the idea of democracy but rather joined the revolt to overthrow the government after they were promised a 'new' age for White Russia, without squabbling or corruption. This political void has been seen as an opportunity for some ambitious White Russian generals and anti-liberal figures, who have begun proposing different and less democratic views on this idea of a new government."
rus.20.d:0 "A long and tiresome debate in the temporary government has deemed that the best way to deal with this political issue is to host an electoral process, temporarily organized with some restrictions towards pacifists and pro-Soviets which may or may not be removed depending on the electoral results. In other words, the issue has been postponed towards the future."
rus.21.d:0 "The temporary government has scheduled elections towards the near future, with the presence of observers from the Allied Eastern Russian Commission to guarantee their legitimacy. Hopefully, good things will come out of this electoral process."
rus.22.d:0 "Elections have come! Disputing for the leadership of White Russia, are two major blocs with which most politicians have sided with; the populist Union for the Salvation of the Motherland and the leftist Union of Regeneration, and lastly the more moderate National Center. Each of them have a distinct idea on how to reform the nation, how to bring about economical growth and how to stabilize the government effectively."
rus.23.d:0 "Unnanounced and unseen, the ripples of the London Stock Market Crash have hit East Asia and have now brought, into our nation, economical troubles. Companies have retracted from the region, income has declined, unemployment has soared and we now stand destabilized and damaged."
rus.24.d:0 "With the massive decline in governmental budget and large issues in dealing with financial worries, the privatization of large amounts of most major state-owned companies has been suggested. These would be privatized to businesses less afflicted by the crisis and would likely bring some benefits (as well as issues). What say we?"

rusur.1.d:0 "After a tough electoral race, the Union of Regeneration has won the election. They have promised to create a progressive welfare state, help the economy and continue the fight against the USSR."
rusur.2.d:0 "Today one of our government ministers, Boris Savinkov, was assassinated at his workplace. Believed to have been committed by Bolsheviks, it marks an end for an important figure in the construction of our nation. A day of mourning has already been declared."
rusnus.1.d:0 "The NUS, a very peculiar party has won the election with the Oktoberists as a junior partner. The cabinet, led by Wrangel and Georgievsky, is now starting their work. They are already giving out loans to farmers in order to mechanize the agriculture industry while laying the groundwork for the nationalization of major industries and the reformation of the school system."
rusnus.2.d:0 "Political discussion has led to the factionalizing of our ruling party. On the right, a faction self-labelling themselves the 'Neo-Stolypinists' are led by Arkadiy Stolypin, son of Stolypin. They want to modernize Stolypin's ideas and apply them in this new politcal context. Against these up and coming traditionalist reformers, the Union of "Young Russia" has also been established. Modelling themselves after the ideals of Valkist Germany and using some concepts of the USSR to create a stronger Russia, they call for a strong, totalitarian state overseeing a tightly-controlled economy."
rusnus.3.d:0 "As part of the NUS' programme, they propose and aim to implement the creation of a technocratic governance that is representative of professionals and those skilled in their respective jobs. This proposal would see the disbanding of parliament and the immediate appointmnet of scientists, writers and engineers to form a new parliamentary institution. While the people have voted in the NUS knowing of this idea, the entirety of the opposition opposes their views and implementing would likely be through authoritarian and anti-democratic measures. Should we go ahead with the NUS' proposal?"
rusnus.4.d:0 "."
rusnus.5.d:0 "As part of the NUS' programme, they propose and aim to implement the creation of a technocratic governance that is representative of professionals and those skilled in their respective jobs.

While the people have voted in the NUS knowing of this idea, the entirety of the opposition opposes their views and implementing would likely be through authoritarian and anti-democratic measures. Should we go ahead with the NUS' proposal?"
rusnus.7.d:0 "The partisan parliament has been overruled through force and a new technocratic organ is being formed to replace it. In order to assure that this idea is proper, the NUS plans on basing the formation of such a legislative body on both recognition of merit and an elective process where only other professionals would elect their own professional class. This should be finalized in the coming days and see a new era of governance arise in White Russia."
rusnp.1.d:0 "The political deadlock in the current provisional government has brought in political radicalization and not only that, has made international actors anxious towards the stability of this country. Apparently, Japanese officials have been secretly meeting behind the government's back with the military in regards to solving this issue once and for all."
rusnp.2.d:0 "The effective collapse of the government and the declaration by the NUS and Oktoberists of their refusal to comply to the demands of some pro-Soviet traitorous parties yesterday has brought the determination needed to the military that the only solution to the current predicament lies with a foreign-backed coup. Thus, led by Spiridon Dionisovich Merkulov, a group of military officials funded and influenced by Japan, invaded the government offices earlier this morning and suspended the constitution. While this solution isn't ideal, it will will likely hold back political chaos enough to prevent a direct military intervention in White Russia by the Japanese or worse, the Soviets- in an ideal world that is. However, some suspect that this Japanese support is a ploy to hide their real intentions of invading White Russia."
rusnp.3.d:0 "Seeing they aren't able to beat us back, Japan has agreed to a white peace. The only condition they gave is that the Russian State will not nationalize Japanese companies and assets without compensation."
rusnp.4.d:0 "With our success against Japan, even taking Korea has made them force to offer us a peace deal that allows us to freely nationalize Japanese Companies in Russia without compensation."   
rusnp.5.d:0 "Kornilov has passed away last night. The duty of governing in these rough times didn't have a good effect on his health which resulted in his death. This makes his second in command Diterikhs the natural successor, someone who has quite radical ideas." 
rusnp.6.d:0 "We will start Operation Ocharina- a plan to remove the traitorous elements of our state. This includes arresting socialist, democrats amd other groups that oppose our rule."                 

rusinf.1.d:0 "American influence on our nation is low. This should hopefully mean that our government can act autonomously."
rusinf.2.d:0 "Slowly by slowly, through diplomatic, political and economical means, the USA is expanding its influence on our nation. We should be careful."

ruscoup.1.d:0 "In its moment of weakness, the previous nationalist administration has been couped by pro-democracy military officials. Now aiming to undo the wrongs of the nationalists, hopefully, this new military provisional government will bring democracy and stability back to Russia, and legitimize it once more as the enemy of the Soviets."      
ruscoup.2.d:0 "With the support of the Oktoberists, previous administration has been couped by the factions in the NUS that had been sidelined. Declaring the need to construct a proper and realistic administration which will fulfill its promises and resume war with the Soviet Union, they now seek to insert their own ideologies into the government. However, a power struggle has broken out amongst both the sidelined factions and the outcome of this will decide what kind of new administration will arise. Should the Neo-Stolypinist succeed, they will bring traditionalist reformism into the nation. Meanwhile, should the Union of 'Young Russia' win the power struggle, they will implement their radical authoritarian ideas"    
ruscoup.3.d:0 "Denikin's attempts in building a dictatorship which ran counter his promises to restore democracy have led to him being couped by Pyotr Wrangel."
ruscoup.4.d:0 "Finally, after all these years we have held proper elections. Now, the only remaining question is: who will them?"
